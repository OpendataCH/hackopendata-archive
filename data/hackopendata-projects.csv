Energy consumption in buildings and industry is often wasted due to user behaviour, human error, and poorly performing equipment.

One of the main factor who lead to NCDs is an unhealthy diet which is correlated with a high sugar intake.

As car manufacturers and the world turn towards this technology with the goal of lowering greenhouse gas emissions and as this technology gains momentum, a lot of discussions arise, bringing conflicting arguments, myths, assumptions and open questions to the surface. This we have in abundance… What we lack is real data and facts based on this data to support all these theoretical discussions.

Wie die aktuellen Ereignisse in Deutschland und in der Schweiz gezeigt haben, müssen ausserordentliche Naturereignisse auf regionaler und überregionaler Ebene in die Planung mit einbezogen werden. Eine frühzeitige Erkennung der Entwicklungen gibt Behörden und Einsatzkräften wertvolle zusätzliche Zeit für kritische Massnahmen wie die Einrichtung von Schutzvorrichtungen oder Evakuierungen.

======

Visistrom helps individuals to plan using electricity at a good time in order to use sustainable energy as much as possible. 
In turn, this behaviour helps utility companies to reduce energy purchases from expensive sources like coal and oil plants. 

## Energy Hack Days 

This project emerged from the following Open Energy Hack Days challenge: [Visistrom challenge](https://hack.opendata.ch/project/289).

Ziel von *What is Watt* ist es, alles mit allem zu vergleichen. Wie viel Energie verbraucht meine tägliche Pendler-Zugfahrt? (12.8 kWh) Und wie oft kann ich mit dieser Energie heiss duschen? (9 Mal) Oder einen Stock mit dem Lift fahren? (1200 Mal) Es bleibt am Ende die Entscheidung der einzelnen Person, ob sie nun näher zu ihrem Arbeitsort zieht oder weniger lang/heiss duscht, um Energie zu sparen.

* **Climate:** If food loss and waste were a country, it’d be the 3th largest greenhouse gas emitter after China and the US.
