The e-Merchant (Seller) then sends the ordered items in a package (or packages) to the Consumer (Buyer). \r\nThis package may then be carried by multiple different transporters (postal and/or non-postal). \r\nUltimately, the package may then be delivered to the location of the Consumers choice (often the home).\r\n\r\n#### Problem:\r\nCurrently, each transporter needs to receive a data-set in advance of the package being handed over to him/her. \r\nIn general, each transporter will have its own requirements related to structure of the data set (and contents). All too often, each transporter also insists on their own format for the label affixed to the package (leading to relabelling along the journey of the package). \r\n*Moreover, each transporter may insist on using its own (proprietary) identifier for the package. *\r\n**This creates a lot of confusion when communicating about the progress of delivery of the goods ordered transported in the package/s.**\r\n\r\n#### For:\r\nThe sending **e-Merchant** as well as the **Consumer** (hopefully receiving the package and the goods s/he ordered) both **desire to be able to consistently track where the Goods Sold/Bought are.** Because of the issues mentioned above, it is difficult for the e-Merchant to provide the Consumer with that tracking information (because the transporters involved have troubles providing the necessary feedback about the package). \r\nFurthermore, the **proprietary information exchanges as well as the relabelling adds (unnecessary) cost and time ** to the end-to-end process of transporting the package from Seller to Buyer. \r\nThis affects the transporters mostly, but also the Seller and Buyer, because the transporters will include those additional costs into their charges one way or another.\r\nThe [Scan4Transport standard ](https://www.gs1.org/industries/transport-and-logistics/scan4transport)provides a globally standardised way to include structured data into a 2D barcode.That enables any party reading the 2D barcode structured according to the standard to correctly interpret the data encoded in the 2D barcode **regardless of the party that created the 2D barcode** (according to the standard).\r\n\r\n#### Goal:\r\n1. As a minimum, it would be good to show that the 2D barcodes can act as \u201cfall-back\u201d for lack of prior information exchanges. \r\nSo reading a barcode and correctly interpreting the contents (and showing this in a screen (mobile phone or browser) to a user. \r\n3. The user, should then be able to access the latest/additional information from a remote application (via the Web) based on the above mentioned standards. \r\nThis may be a basic display on a Web-browser or retrieval via an API and showing that within a self-built App on the Mobile Device. \r\n4. The third \u201clayer\u201d would be that the operator may log an Event with a remote application (e.g., confirmation of delivery, hand-over to next transporter). \r\nThis may be done via a Web-browser, an API directly to the remote Application and/or posting the Event to an EPCIS application (as described in the UN/CEFACT standard [Integrated Track and Trace for Multi-Modal Transportation](https://www.slideshare.net/JacoVoorspuij/brsintegratedtrackandtraceformultimodaltransportationv01finalpdf) as a good way to easily exchange Event-Information among disparate systems). \r\n\r\nIt would be fantastic if more than one hacking team would work on this challenge and each one would focus on (parts of) the above scenario to show that a package carrying the same label with the same 2D barcode may easily be processed by different software. That would prove interoperability of these standards. \r\nThe Hackathon may also provide valuable learnings related to shortcomings in the standards (e.g., ambiguity in how to interpret them when converting them into software implementations.\r\n\r\n##### Challenge Owner:\r\nJaco Voorspuij\t\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://bucketeer-036aa605-c047-4623-8610-f1764b90cf98.s3.amazonaws.com/upu/54/40HV5WJJ8Z1I48DVHAC4T851/Jaco_Voorspuij__Torso_and_Head__Square.jpg\" width=256>","maintainer":"","name":"Making packages talk","phase":"Share","progress":50,"score":100,"source_url":"https://github.com/vygkaz/scan4track","stats":{"commits":50,"during":70,"people":5,"sizepitch":4604,"sizetotal":4744,"total":85,"updates":80},"summary":"Putting data required for correct handling on the box in a globally standardised way independent of Sender, Carrier or Receiver","team":"Jaco_Voorspuij, Alqahtanighadah, smolovskis, SRazmus, Vygantas","team_count":5,"updated_at":"2023-06-24T12:43","url":"https://dribdat.hackathon.post/project/3","webpage_url":"https://bucketeer-036aa605-c047-4623-8610-f1764b90cf98.s3.amazonaws.com/upu/59/U39X0NQFXRL852N35AOETEZ2/SYNCCODE_2.pdf"},{"autotext":"# upu-hackathon-2023\r\n\r\n## Intro\r\nThis repo is just a pointer to the tools used by the Team Unitiy during the [Postal Data Hackathon 2023UPU](https://www.upu.int/en/Universal-Postal-Union/Activities/Digital-Services/Postal-Data-Hackathon).\r\n\r\n## vLEI\r\nThe vLEI is a open standard type of W3C Verifiable Credential (VC) that leverages the W3C Decentralized Identifier (DID) standard.

But Pulse Network needs to make sure that Dr. Simona's credentials are indeed signed by a trusted entity, in this case, the Nigirian government. Pulse Network gets Dr. Simona's credentials, extracts the signer's DID and uses [TRAIN - TRust mAnagement INfrastructure](https://essif-lab.eu/essif-train-by-fraunhofer-gesellschaft/) (see example [repo](https://github.com/undp/Regi-TRUST/tree/main)) to check if the Nigerian country is indeed a trusted party.\r\nPulse Network calls the verification API endpoint https://essif.trust-scheme.de/atvtrain/api/v1/ssi/ adding the below JSON payload (you can try it too! Please use it as POST request):\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"Issuer\": \"did:web:nimc.gov.ng\",\r\n  \"Trust_Scheme_Pointer\": \"upu.train.trust-scheme.de\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Issuer\" is the Nigerian government DID and the \"Trust_Scheme_Pointer\" is where the Trust List of trusted countries is hosted (upu.train.trust-scheme.de for the hackathon purposes).\r\n\r\nThis is the final response that confirms the Nigerian country as a trusted party:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"VerificationStatus\": \"OK\",\r\n    \"VerificationResult\": {\r\n        \"ReceivedTrustSchemePointer\": \"upu.train.trust-scheme.de\",\r\n        \"FindingCorrespondingTrustSchemeInitiated\": \"OK\",\r\n        \"FoundCorrespondingTrustScheme\": \"upu.train.trust-scheme.de\",\r\n        \"TrustListDiscoveryInitiated\": \"OK\",\r\n        \"TrustListFoundAndLoaded\": \"https://tspa.trust-scheme.de/tspa_train_domain/api/v1/scheme/upu.train.trust-scheme.de\",\r\n        \"FoundIssuer\": \"did:web:nimc.gov.ng\",\r\n        \"ServiceTypeIdentifier\": \"http://vcissuer.ngi.train.trustscheme.de\",\r\n        \"VerifyIssuer\": \"OK\",\r\n        \"VerificationSuccessful\": \"OK\"\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs for the next step, our dedicated team showcased an innovative solution for enhancing supply chain auditability by successfully setting up a demo Keri witness network. Using the Keri CLI provided by the GitHub repository https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keripy, we created demo vLEIs for various participants involved in our challenge transaction. As part of our proof of concept, we signed postal data, verified its authenticity, and imagined a scenario in which we could further enhance trustworthiness by verifying the vLEIs as well. Drawing upon elements from the script https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keripy/blob/b03ccf2dc8a92885d97c4ca5f36486b8fc0b469a/scripts/demo/vLEI/issue-xbrl-attestation.sh, our creative solution demonstrated the potential for improved traceability and greater transparency in global supply chain processes.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Challenge: \ud83d\udcce [Challege-9-Team Unity 2023 Hackathon Presentation.pdf](https://bucketeer-036aa605-c047-4623-8610-f1764b90cf98.s3.amazonaws.com/upu/15/FZVFQ4I82V1872GVU6NAOLAG/Challege9Team_Unity_2023_Hackathon_Presentation.pdf)\r\n\r\n\r\n[According to DHL](https://www.dhl.com/discover/en-sg/logistics-advice/import-export-advice/3-ways-to-approach-cross-border-shipping-challenges), Customs Compliance and Logistics are considered to be their two most important challenges for cross-border shipping of Cargo/Posts. Since Countries have their own regulations on the quality of products that can be imported. If products do not comply with any nation\u2019s regulatory process, respective freights would not be able to enter the country. And in logistics because of the involvement of multiple carrier handoffs (3PLs) it might be difficult to track orders of the shipments or freights which in turn can lead to potential delays of the shipments. \r\n\r\nWe propose a novel approach by coupling secure digital identities with aggregated postal data from trusted sources (.e.g UPU, Designated Operators, private sector 3PLs) that could provide a potential solution to increase the security, efficiency, and quality of logistics in cross-border delivery of Cargo/Posts. \r\n\r\n### Use case Specific Problem Statements\r\n\r\n**#1 Cross Border Movement of Pharmaceutical Products**\r\n\r\nAccording to Pharma News Intelligence, the global revenue associated with the pharmaceutical industry is in excess of $1.4 trillion. In Switzerland, the KOF Swiss Economic Institute has estimated that pharmaceuticals accounted for over one-third of Swiss exported products. In 2021 the German Federal Supreme Administrative Court in 2021 invalidated a long standing business model of a Swiss licensed pharmacy company relying upon its Swiss license to sell goods to a German Distributor that were directly shipped from a French affiliate, with the pharmaceutical product never transiting through Switzerland. Providing the pharmaceutical industry access to multiple trusted registry data sources (postal data, licensure data, import/export data, etc.) can help facilitate the movement of pharmaceutical goods through the supply chain in a legally compliant manner. \r\n\r\n**#2 Use of Drones in the Shipment of Pharmaceuticals & Medical Goods**\r\n\r\nA growing number of government regulators are exploring the use of drones in expediting the shipment of pharmaceuticals and medical products. These use cases involve both urban and rural settings. By way of example, the Telangana state government in India completed a pilot in 2021 where 175 shipments (some in temperature controlled boxes) were delivered via drones over a 21 day period. In Austria, the Red Cross in conjunction with Thales demonstrated the delivery of a blood supply via drone in 2021. Wider deployment of this use case would require timely and secure access to multiple trust registry data sources (postal data and licensure data (medical & business). The need for accurate postal data for these types of use cases are increasingly important when they involve drones, as the movement of these drones in a three dimensional air volume are critically important for their safe and secure operation. \r\n\r\n# Goal\r\n\r\nDemonstrate the viability of using multiple trust registries to improve the overall security, efficiency and quality of care within the healthcare ecosystem. Specifically, the hackathon will seek to demonstrate how multiples trusted source of data (including postal data from UPU or Designated Operator can facilitate the movement of a pharmaceutical and medical products through the supply chain.\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udcce [Challege-9-Team Unity 2023 Hackathon Presentation.pdf](https://bucketeer-036aa605-c047-4623-8610-f1764b90cf98.s3.amazonaws.com/upu/15/FZVFQ4I82V1872GVU6NAOLAG/Challege9Team_Unity_2023_Hackathon_Presentation.pdf)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChallenge Owner: Michael Palage, InfoNetworks","maintainer":"","name":"Coupling Digital Identities","phase":"Prototype","progress":30,"score":97,"source_url":"https://github.com/jcamilov/upu-hackathon-2023","stats":{"commits":2,"during":36,"people":9,"sizepitch":6789,"sizetotal":7911,"total":44,"updates":35},"summary":"Coupling secure Digital Identities with trusted postal data to improve security and efficiency of Cross-Border delivery of Cargo/Posts.","team":"xiaodi, salvatoreporcheddu, vargasjuan, Michael_Palage, Santoshgk, LoekBoortman, HeinzDanielGRAF, MikhailSoloviev, AlexZambrano","team_count":9,"updated_at":"2023-06-26T07:54","url":"https://dribdat.hackathon.post/project/9","webpage_url":"https://bucketeer-036aa605-c047-4623-8610-f1764b90cf98.s3.amazonaws.com/upu/22/F91KOVL6U8M3QC3KPU7O1RSW/HackathonFinalPresentation.pdf"},{"autotext":"","autotext_url":"https://github.com/SaruRonin/UPUAPI.git","category_id":"","category_name":"","contact_url":"https://github.com/SaruRonin/UPUAPI/issues","created_at":"2023-05-30T07:39","download_url":"https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiYTZhMjA4MmYtYjJiYi00OTJkLWE3ZGQtMmY1ZDE4NWM4ZjUyIiwid","event_name":"Postal Data Hackathon 2023","event_url":"https://dribdat.hackathon.post/event/1","excerpt":"Link to final Pitch Deck: \ud83d\udcce [Ensuring Resilience in the Postal Economy.pdf](https://bucketeer-036aa605-c047-4623-8610-f1764b90cf98.s3.amazonaws.com/upu/6/KHC7UCNCJ5VP099ZHH5LV2IZ/Ensuring_Resilience_in_the_Postal_Economy.pdf)\r\n\r\n**SUMMARY**\r\n\r\nThe challenge is to use multiple data sources, but with a specific focus on **OPEN DATA**, to develop solutions that enhance the resilience of the postal sector in the digital economy.

The demand is created for plastic packaging by senders, but plastic waste is handled by recipients at the destination. New business models are needed to create the incentives for circular approaches within the sector, as well as in other sectors. To make this possible, plastic life cycle data is required for understanding the uses of plastics packaging, the movement of plastic products, reuse and disposal. \r\n\r\n**For:** For postal operators, plastics value chain players and for green economy policy makers. \r\n\r\n**Goal:** The expected outcome is to harness the value of postal data and broader logistics sector data for enabling the identification of plastics patterns and flow through parcel data of e-commerce transactions of international posts (e.g. sources of internal plastics package in parcels by products, sectors that are heavily reliant on plastics for transportation, existing practices of recycling and reuse of plastics package in different destinations). Ultimately the goal is to improve data information flow, incentivize new business models of circular economy to close the material loop around plastics, while also informing green economy policies and plastics regulations to incentivize the behavior changes of the sector and the customers (e.g. adopt border measures for plastics alternatives or economic incentives for reuse and recycling models for transportation materials). \r\n\r\n**Potential solutions:** We are interested in how we can use UPU data to tell us about the movement of plastics in the postal sector. As a broad category, plastics in the postal sector include the packaging of products by retailers or producers, postal packaging, and the plastics in products themselves. At the moment, plastic consumption data and data on the movement of plastics is severely lacking. Instead, analysts rely on plastic production data, and plastic waste data where available. We think the postal sector has a unique perspective on how plastics are consumed and how they move around the world. \r\n\r\nIn addition to current data collection practices, participants will explore how other technologies could be used to gather further information and enable data-driven solutions to incentivize new business models. Internet-of-things or computer vision technologies could improve the recognition of plastic packaging in transit. Machine learning approaches could be used for identifying flows of plastics across borders in real time or predicting plastic waste hotspots. Natural language processing applications could also be used to facilitate data collection from customs declarations. Additionally, online platforms or user-friendly applications could be developed to create incentives to share information on plastic use for packaging.\r\n\r\n**Data Resources:** For this challenge, we firstly hope to focus on UPU data as a new resource for understanding the life cycle of plastics. This may be supplemented by existing data sources, such as data on plastics generation and recycling rates, as well as trade data. A list of additional data resources that may be useful are listed here with some brief explanation, as well as some potential fields of interest from the UPU data: \ud83d\udcce [Additional Data Resources.pdf](https://bucketeer-036aa605-c047-4623-8610-f1764b90cf98.s3.amazonaws.com/upu/16/DI13P2157GS54JKQ0OZUC8JL/Additional_Data_Resources.pdf)\r\n\r\n**Challenge Owners:**\r\nAna Gabriela Fernandez Vergara, Angus Hamilton and Nicole Weller","maintainer":"AnaGabrielaFV","name":"Data-driven solutions for plastic pollution","phase":"Prototype","progress":30,"score":65,"source_url":"","stats":{"commits":0,"during":5,"people":10,"sizepitch":4280,"sizetotal":4403,"total":24,"updates":13},"summary":"Using data-driven solutions for incentivizing circularity approaches within the postal sector to address plastic pollution.

By tracking the flow of electronic goods deliveries via the postal sector, we can infer regional development trends in the internet and e-services environment. The challenge is to analyse the flow of consumer electronics deliveries to understand where these technologies are most utilized. Moreover, analysing trade data can help us identify the key suppliers and consumers of these products, providing insights into the infrastructure and digital services development trends. Leveraging this data, our aim is to generate visual representations and maps that depict the current landscape in the digital and communication services sector. Further, we seek to construct predictive models to forecast changes in these sectors' development. This will assist in identifying areas of growth and potential risk areas that may fall behind in terms of connectivity and digital services. \r\n\r\nFor: For stakeholders in the digital and telecommunication sectors, international organizations, funds, and initiatives, aiming to locate areas and regions where their efforts can be most effectively directed.\r\n\r\nGoal: Create a solution that leverages postal and trade data on electronics flow (user\u2019s and provider\u2019s segment) to identify tendencies, predict changes, and consequently drive informed decisions in the digital connectivity sphere.\r\n\r\nPotential solutions: We aim to use UPU data to obtain insights into the development of the digital and internet connectivity sectors. Participants can utilize the data collected by the ITU on ICT access, use, and affordability. The ITU's statistical database, found at https://datahub.itu.int/indicators/, provides details on ICT infrastructure development, usage, and service affordability. The UPU and Comtrade databases can also be leveraged, analysing goods with HS codes such as 851761, 851762, 851769, etc. Other open-source databases, including geospatial ones, can be incorporated as well.\r\n\r\nChallenge Owner: Ihar Shchetko\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udcce [Initial presentation](https://bucketeer-036aa605-c047-4623-8610-f1764b90cf98.s3.amazonaws.com/upu/58/WBOMRSNVXI9DN8N150MA4HE4/Bridging_Digital_Divide_UPU_Challenge.pdf) (PDF)\r\n","maintainer":"Ihar","name":"Bridging the Digital Divide","phase":"Launch","progress":40,"score":64,"source_url":"","stats":{"commits":0,"during":7,"people":4,"sizepitch":3230,"sizetotal":3291,"total":13,"updates":8},"summary":"Enhancing Connectivity through Postal and Trade Data Analysis","team":"Ihar, stephan, anne_pratx, iainwilliams","team_count":4,"updated_at":"2023-06-26T07:53","url":"https://dribdat.hackathon.post/project/16","webpage_url":"https://bucketeer-036aa605-c047-4623-8610-f1764b90cf98.s3.amazonaws.com/upu/1/ME2WANDPUEACEDZFOC4JVWLS/Bridging_the_digital_divide.pdf"},{"autotext":"Preferred choice of eCommerce Delivery\r\n---\r\n\r\nPostal services around the world are losing customers are losing markets and having a common problem.\r\nWe are trying to come up with a product or service that would help the postal administrations be the first port of call for e-commerce.\r\n\r\nSee details in https://dribdat.hackathon.post/project/2\r\n\r\n### What is our proposed solution?\r\n\r\nHow: it is possible to come up with a customer Identity, linked to a database that postal administrations already have, and one that we could make better use of. We are focusing on Ghana as a case study, where there is a DB of consumer identities and GPS-based, verified locations. We are discussing developing this data in a way that both makes the postal service useful for e-commerce, as well as protecting privacy and building trust with all users. A strong consumer identity would allow us to apply data science, and make sure that we have analysed the preferences, demographics, etc., ethically and correctly.\r\n\r\n### What are our most apparent roadblocks?\r\n\r\nWe need to ensure sure that the consumers continue trust us - in particulra, so that they continue updating their data with us. A number of approaches were discussed, including Trust Labels, codes of conduct, benchmarking and new types of government regulation for digital services.\r\n\r\nThe next part is how to excite consumers to work with us and share their data. Currently in the marketplace, businesses are trying constantly to sell to consumers - but people want to buy, rather than be sold to. Consumers feel like they are being lured into buying. Junk mail is a huge global environmental and social problem, and rather than adding to it, we want to create economically compelling alternatives that are better for the resident, and the planet. \r\n\r\nSuppose we can say that we have 5000 consumers ready to buy new shoes. Are you, the shoe brand, willing to give them a discount? We can link them to the manufacturers or businesses through their postal ID, allowing us to be the liaison between the consumer and manufacturer athe first first level. However, we must have an equivocal and open marketplace for this to work. In Ghana the MTM and Expresspay are two examples of mobile payments apps, somewhat similar to TWINT in Switzerland, that could be combined with Postal data to improve customer profiling for algorithmic offers. \r\n\r\nAs postal administrators, we do not deliver to locations, but to people. We do not even really \"need\" the locations - we need the people! The missing link is the consumer ID, the virtual personality of the consumer. Imagine that we have an app that allows consumers to show their preferences at some point in time. For example, I am looking for a car or mobile phone. The consumer gives us an opportunity to send them information or offers on that topic.\r\n\r\nResearching the context\r\n\r\nIn order to understand the situation in their country, our team members from the Ghana Post (a government-owned corporation responsible for postal service in Ghana and a member of the West African Postal Conference) gave us many insights into the administrative, cultural, and geographic aspects of the postal sector.\r\n\r\nWe looked up topics on Wikipedia, used OpenStreetMap and Open Data for Africa to access basic datasets, referenced the Global Data Barometer and latest UN Country Team report and information from the UPU about the country's membership. All the links are cited below.\r\n\r\nPrototyping approach\r\n\r\nWe have support from software integration consultants Tao Digital, as well as test access to the Amazon Lightsail product.\r\n\r\nOn day I we used a design thinking tool, the How-Now-Wow Matrix, to sort through a wide range of opportunities that we came up with for Ghana Post during our sessions as a team. Participants from Ghana, France, Cameroon, Switzerland and the USA were involved in supporting these efforts. At the end of the day we came up with the name \"GhanaLife\" to express our idea for this new identity. We do not intend to infringe upon the name of a life insurance company, rather convey the message that beyond Proximity and Relocations, it is the Signs of Life are the focus of our interest.\r\n\r\nOur goal for day II is to set up a shared Data Analytics platform, and create a number of infographics based on a statistical analysis of some of the data provided by the UPU and the open data available to us. We plan to include this in our presentation addressed at \"leapfrogging the status quo\" in postal services, confronting the perception that the work of postal workers is only in moving letters and parcels around, and presenting some declarative statements around the commitments that need to be maintained for a fair, sustainable, pragmatic solution to the problem above. Depending on how much time we are able to productively use, our further goals would be to demo:\r\n    \r\n\t* Concept and software architecture of an identity management app for Ghana Post customers.\r\n\t* A system for collecting and updating personal details in a safe and reliable way.\r\n\t* Linkable analytics based on the GPS location data from the Ghana Post.\r\n\t* Integrations with external e-commerce platform APIs (Jumia, Shopify, Amazon etc.)\r\n\t* Verification using mobile phone message, or with the Ghana Card.\r\n\r\n### Resources\r\n\r\nTools\r\n\r\n- https://dribdat.hackathon.post/event/2/stages\r\n- http://metabase.datalets.ch/browse\r\n\r\nGeneral\r\n\r\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghana#Media\r\n- https://ghana.un.org/en/197169-unct-results-report-2021-ghana\r\n- https://www.upu.int/en/Universal-Postal-Union/About-UPU/Member-Countries\r\n- https://etradeforall.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/UPU-BoostingECommerceAHowToGuideForPostalOperatorsEn-1.pdf\r\n- https://news.un.org/en/story/2021/05/1091182\r\n- https://taodigitalusa.com/about-us/\r\n\r\nOpen Data and Personal Identity\r\n\r\n- https://blog.okfn.org/2023/05/04/odd2023-stories-ghana/\r\n- https://schoolofdata.org/2015/10/20/the-state-of-open-data-in-ghana-policy/\r\n- https://ghana.opendataforafrica.org/sfdufwe/consumer-price-index-cpi-for-november-2017\r\n- https://ghana.opendataforafrica.org/data/#menu=topic\r\n- https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/192781#map=7/7.433/-0.615&layers=H\r\n- https://globaldatabarometer.org/country/ghana/\r\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Once-only_principle\r\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-sovereign_identity\r\n\r\nSwiss perspective\r\n\r\n- https://www.efd.admin.ch/efd/en/home/digitalisation/swiss-digital-initiative.html\r\n- https://www.post.ch/en/business-solutions/e-voting/the-e-voting-solution-for-cantons#how-it-works\r\n- https://www.swissid.ch/en/geschaeftskunden/referenz-cases.html\r\n- https://www.sbfi.admin.ch/sbfi/en/home/eri-policy/eri-21-24/cross-cutting-themes/digitalisation-eri/artificial-intelligence.html\r\n- https://www.zas.admin.ch/zas/en/home/particuliers/obligation-d-informer-pour-les-rentiers/controle-de-l-exitence-en-vie-.html\r\n\r\n### Examples in other countries\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1HwHBvxOO8 (Integrating Canada Post and Shopify)\r\n\r\nhttps://www.canadapost-postescanada.ca/cpc/en/business/postal-services/digital-proof-identity.page\r\n\r\nhttps://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/india-post-rides-e-tail-boom-reaps-big-rewards/\r\n\r\n### Media\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was agreed that now that the Ghana card has made a lot of impact in our society \u2013 as we speak now, almost 17 million Ghanaians have registered for the Ghana card, so, the Commission, in collaboration with our partners, took the decision that: \u2018Now, let\u2019s have the Ghana card as the main requirement\u2019\u201d, Dr Bossman Asare, Deputy Chairman of the EC in charge of Corporate Services, said.\r\nhttps://www.classfmonline.com/news/politics/Jean-Mensa-finally-shows-up-in-parliament-over-Only-Ghanacard-for-voter-registration-C-I-39950\r\n\r\n\u201cI am not the one saying it, but if you look at the figures from the NIA, then you will understand that even there are more people \u2013 more people than the 7.9 million people whose SIM cards have been blocked\u2026 if you put the number of people who are looking for Ghana Cards in general and cannot get, they are countless people\u201d -- Dr. Abed Bandim\r\nhttps://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/The-7-9-million-Ghanaians-whose-SIM-cards-have-been-blocked-did-not-fail-MP-1789805\r\n\r\n\u201cThe automatic link occurred when the individual's data transferred from the database of the NIA to that of the GRA were in sync and automatically linked by the integrated system, while the manual link occurred when an individual's data transferred from the database of the NIA to the database of the GRA were not in sync\u201d --  Dr Owusu-Amoah\r\nhttps://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/business/More-than-10-million-Ghana-Cards-holders-not-registered-as-taxpayers-GRA-1785884\r\n","autotext_url":"https://pad.okfn.de/p/hackathon-post-2023-2","category_id":"","category_name":"","contact_url":"","created_at":"2023-05-30T07:54","download_url":"","event_name":"Postal Data Hackathon 2023","event_url":"https://dribdat.hackathon.post/event/1","excerpt":"# Challenge\r\n\r\n\"We know e-commerce / cross border is growing.

In addition, cross-border eCommerce has to deal with import customs clearance issues.\r\n\r\nBut last-mile delivery generates various problems: heavy traffic in cities, leading to congestion and pollution, uncertainty as to whether the recipient will be present, necessitating redelivery or delivery on standby, payment of tax and duties for clearance, and therefore the high cost of home delivery.\r\n\r\nParcel lockers are a possible solution, but there are too many competing lockers on the market.\r\n\r\nOn the streets, in station lobbies and shopping malls, lockers are multiplying in the colors of each operator, from worldwide integrators to local independent carriers, as well as those of the stores and e-tailers themselves.\r\n\r\nThe solution for the government and the regulation authority is to organize this activity and optimize streets use around a single operator capable of managing all parcel lockers for carriers and online sellers.\r\nThe shared locker solution for sustainable, optimized use of public space, and contributing to the postal operator's central position in e-commerce.\r\n\r\n#### Stage #1: Design the Value Proposition\r\n\r\nRequired skills:\r\n\r\n- Problem identification and analysis\r\n- Market research\r\n- Value Proposition design\r\n- Rapid prototyping\r\n- Teamwork and collaboration\r\n- Flexibility and adaptability\r\n\r\nThis is a marketing and business development challenge focused on digital solutions, that posts may use to discuss with the supervising ministry and regulation authority.\r\n\r\nDefine the ideal benefits and features of shared lockers for carriers and consignees.\r\n\r\nCreate a profitable business model (BUILD and RUN) for shared lockers, including fixed and variable costs and revenues for the various stakeholders.\r\n\r\nConsider the volume of parcels delivered and returned using shared lockers.\r\n\r\n#### Stage #2: Design the App to manage shared lockers\r\n\r\nDesign an application enabling carriers to obtain available spaces in shared lockers and use them for pickup and delivery*, as well as for payment of customs clearance tax and duties (use of ITMATT data).\r\n\r\nDesign an application enabling the postal operator to manage/supervise different lockers, optimize spaces and invoice carriers.\r\n\r\nDesign an application enabling buyers (recipients) to pay duties and taxes in lockers, to pick up and drop off their parcels in the lockers whatever the carrier is.\r\n(* Pickup issue can be studied later.)\r\n\r\nRequired skills:\r\n\r\n- Problem solving\r\n- Rapid prototyping (time management)\r\n- Programming capabilities (various languages)\r\n- Mobile and/or Web development\r\n- User interface  (UI) and User experience (UX)\r\n- Debugging and troubleshooting\r\n- Teamwork and collaboration\r\n\r\nThis is a program design and implementation challenge. The software bricks could be the starting point for an operational solution to present and convince stakeholders in our countries.\r\n\r\nThank you.
