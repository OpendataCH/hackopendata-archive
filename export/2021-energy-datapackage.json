The concept of fractional ownership has been identified as a new possibility to create innovative business models [1]. Utilising tokenisation and DeFi concepts, we could be able to develop flexible, scalable and replicable financing instruments. \r\n\r\n##**The Challenge**\r\n<p></p>\r\nImplement the concept of [fractional ownership](https://github.com/sherminvo/TokenEconomyBook/wiki/Asset-Tokens-&-Fractional-Ownership), tokenisation of energy and utilisation of open-source blockchain and DeFi protocols. Build a MVP for fractionalising digital asset (ownership), lending, borrowing and auctioning of those ownership fractions that allows PV systems owners to (re)finance existing or new projects, and trading ownership rights of their projects. \r\n\r\n##**Skills**\r\n<p></p>\r\nYou do not have to be a full stack developer. Basic knowledge of solidity, javascript or how to build DApp using  the react framework next.js and IPFS would be very helpful. Also, if you are new in blockchain you are very welcome to join the project.

Please join this challenge!\r\n\r\n## Meter data format\r\n\r\n* 'id': Unclear, not used.\r\n* 'Chargepoint': The unique identifier (number or UUID) of the physical charging station. One station can have more than one cable, and hence more than one charging session.\r\n* 'connector': The unique identifier (number or UUID) of the physical cable or attached device. In some cases, a cable can be left in the charging station for a long period of time, and used for multiple charging stations.\r\n* 'charge_log_id': The unique identifier (number or UUID) of a particular session charging a battery\r\n* 'metervalue': Not used\r\n* 'increment': The amount of energy transferred (in watt-hours) in the last 15 minutes (i.e. up to the 'timestamp' value)\r\n* 'timestamp': The time of measurement in UTC.\r\n\r\n## CO2 data format\r\n\r\nColumns are renamed to fit those used in [the notebook here](https://github.com/invveritas/green_charging_emobility/blob/main/Notebooks/Merge%20meter%20with%20CO2%20data.ipynb).\r\n\r\n### Generic columns\r\n\r\n* 'datetime': The time of measurement in UTC.\r\n* 'co2_intensity': The CO2 intensity (g co2/kWh)\r\n* 'co2_production': The CO2 intensity of Swiss production (g co2/kWh)\r\n* 'co2_import': The CO2 intensity of imported electricity (g co2/kWh)\r\n\r\n### Power in the CH consumption mix (production plus imports minus exports)\r\n\r\nAll values in MW\r\n* 'nuclear\r\n* 'geothermal'\r\n* 'biomass'\r\n* 'coal'\r\n* 'wind'\r\n* 'solar'\r\n* 'hydro'\r\n* 'gas'\r\n* 'oil\r\n* 'unknown'\r\n* 'battery'\r\n* 'hydro'\r\n\r\n## Coding standards\r\n\r\nPlease store notebooks in the `Notebooks` directory.\r\n\r\nPlease store data in the `Data` directory. It will be ignored by git.

The maximum power of chargers is 22 kW. The data should be cleaned by removing all values of all charge_log_ids that have at least one value of increment > 5500 Wh.\r\n* Some values for 'Chargepoint' are NaN. Luckily this is only the case where the connector is identified by a UUID. Hence we can replace the NaN with a unique number based on the connector UUID","autotext_url":"https://github.com/invveritas/green_charging_emobility","category_id":"","category_name":"","contact_url":"https://openenergydata.slack.com/archives/C02EKTLLLDN","created_at":"2021-09-03T13:24","download_url":"https://github.com/invveritas/green_charging_emobility/releases","event_name":"Energy Data Hackdays 2021","event_url":"https://hack.energy.opendata.ch/event/6","excerpt":"##\u00a0What is it about?\r\nElectric mobility is a \u201cgreen\u201d alternative to conventional gasoline and diesel cars.

or interest in one or several of these topics:\r\nEnergy, Transport, Food.\r\n\r\n##\tWhy\r\nThe origins of the energy strategy of the city St.Gallen date back to 1992. Driven by the urge to make St.Gallen a green and energy efficient municipality, the strategy is based on a clear vision combined with a wide range of measures on various policy and implementation levels. The acquisition and consolidation of data has been the backbone of St.Gallens ap-proach for many years.\r\n\r\nIn 2020 the city council has decided to further enhance the energy strategy to reach climate neutrality in 2050. Whereas activities until now primarily focused on energy-related measures, the energy strategy is currently extended to include the wide field of consumption. New approaches to foster participation, promote the need to act, define effective measures and monitor achievements are in need. Data will play a significant role.\r\n\r\n##\tData Sources\r\nSeveral datasets are available from the city, from research projects or from open data sources:\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.empa.ch/web/s506/care-project-match\">Material Flow Switzerland (MatCH) Database - EMPA</a></li>\r\n<li>Geb\u00e4udedaten St.Gallen - Energy production and consumption</li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://map.stadt.sg.ch/stadtplan/ext/?lang=de&basemap=sg_basisplan_f&blop=1&x=2745250&y=1254000&zl=5&hl=0&layers=Waermeversorgung\">District heating areas of the city of St.Gallen</a></li>\r\n\r\nThe Data are available on the <a href=\"https://daten.stadt.sg.ch/\">Open Data Platform of the city of St.Gallen</a> with login restrictions.

The most valuable attributes seemed to be \"Amount of contacts to customer center\", \"creditworthiness\" and \"Invoice-Type\". It turned out, that (unfortunately very obvious) people with high contact numbers to the customer center also have a bad creditworthiness (German: Bonity). \r\n\r\nSecondly we found a correlation, that the creditworthiness also correlates to the Invoice-Type. E-Bill-Customers pay their bill very fast (Bonity-Number is low whilst for customers with printed bills, it is much more likely to not pay the bills on time. \r\n\r\nOther correlations - like between the Amount of energy could not be found.\r\n\r\n#Conclusion\r\n\r\nAll in all, the dataset was not very valuable (since it had to be cut down for data protection reasons - we are not allowed to use it internally also).

To keep\r\nappartements cosily warm and to provide always abundantly cold/hot water at any time. However,\r\ncomplex energy and water systems are required to provide this service 24/7. Motivated by the IOT\r\ntrend, also the number of sensors installed and recording data from residential energy systems is\r\nsteadily increasing.\r\nTo operate these systems energy efficiently, clever control strategies are required to prevent\r\noverprovision of hot water or overheating of the rooms. In particular, digital twins attracted recently\r\nmuch attention because these (data-driven) system models enable the optimisation of the energy\r\nsystem without touching it. Join this challenge to explore new applications of data from your home\r\nor to actually build digital twins for hot water provision systems or appartements.\r\n\r\n## The challenge: \r\nIn this challenge you will have the possibility to explore the multiple benefits of digital\r\ntwins. Depending on your background three different directions of the challenge are waiting on you:\r\n\r\n1. Hot water provision: Based on measurement data of a domestic hot water system build a\r\ndigital twin of the system and explore how well you can predict the hot water demand of the\r\nsystem?\r\n\r\n2. Appartement: Start from monitoring data of an apartment and develop a data-driven digital\r\ntwin to predict its behaviour based on external parameters such as the solar radiation.\r\n\r\n3. Ecosystem: Which benefits can digital twin provide in the residential context? Which new\r\napplications could be realised? Who owns a digital twin? Which fears could arise?\r\n\r\nIndependent of whether you are an energy expert, a data scientist or an enthusiast, this challenge\r\noffers you the possibility to contribute to the energy turnaround in your home.\r\n\r\n### Data: \r\nTwo disparate datasets are ready for this challenge:\r\n\r\n1. Monitoring data from two identical domestic hot water preparation system in different\r\nbuildings. This data set is ideally suited if you would like to develop a digital twin yourself or\r\nto showcase the prediction of the hot-water consumption of different users.\r\n\r\n2. Monitoring data from a flat including time-resolved room temperature measurements, heat\r\nfluxes to the rooms and solar radiation data.\r\n\r\n### Presentation \r\nhttps://youtu.be/gstFXCWe4rI?t=2648","maintainer":"","name":"08_Digital twins for domestic heating systems","phase":"Find","progress":5,"score":22,"source_url":"","stats":{"commits":0,"during":2,"people":1,"sizepitch":2489,"sizetotal":2626,"total":2,"updates":1},"summary":"How can digital twins help us to safe energy while keeping our appartements warm and guaranteeing that sufficient hot water is available?","team":"wolfram","team_count":1,"updated_at":"2021-10-26T13:15","url":"https://hack.energy.opendata.ch/project/87","webpage_url":"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vRBqDBoQqQdZXbrKNXzYYQZAGX4ikVOXibj4sGLcfpFzwY8p5vaUYbn8Nrs3vJvig/embed?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000&slide=id.gf01f701ab1_0_29"},{"autotext":"","autotext_url":"","category_id":"","category_name":"","contact_url":"https://openenergydata.slack.com/archives/C02DHPQ95HT","created_at":"2021-08-19T19:41","download_url":"","event_name":"Energy Data Hackdays 2021","event_url":"https://hack.energy.opendata.ch/event/6","excerpt":"##Tasks\r\n* Analysis of historical data (frequency deviation measurements for FCR, control signal sent by Swissgrid for aFRR) to derive patterns in the data (e.g., using Machine Learning techniques, such as clustering)\r\n* Identify the most prominent patterns in the data and collect them into a set of representative signal extracts\r\n* Combine the signal extracts into an overall signal that is representative enough of various scenarios, for example, base-case signal, worst-case signal with regards ...","hashtag":"","id":88,"image_url":"","is_challenge":false,"is_webembed":true,"logo_color":"","logo_icon":"","longtext":"##Tasks\r\n* Analysis of historical data (frequency deviation measurements for FCR, control signal sent by Swissgrid for aFRR) to derive patterns in the data (e.g., using Machine Learning techniques, such as clustering)\r\n* Identify the most prominent patterns in the data and collect them into a set of representative signal extracts\r\n* Combine the signal extracts into an overall signal that is representative enough of various scenarios, for example, base-case signal, worst-case signal with regards to power capacity, worst-case signal with regards to energy capacity, worst-case signal with regards to ramping power, etc.\r\n* Determine the list of tests to be included in the new prequalification test, making use of the signal extracts among other things\r\n\r\n**Note: signing a legal agreement with Swissgrid is required to access some of this data.**","maintainer":"","name":"11_Pre Qualification Test","phase":"Find","progress":5,"score":21,"source_url":"","stats":{"commits":0,"during":2,"people":0,"sizepitch":851,"sizetotal":954,"total":2,"updates":2},"summary":"deriving a representive frequency profile, with which TSO can certfy the providers for the FCR service.
