We are passionate to work on the creation of innovative financing instruments, decentralised energy networks or energy marketplaces. We aim to create sustainable value across the whole energy value chain for our stakeholders and for the society.\r\n\r\n**DAO**<p></p>\r\nA Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) is an organization whose rules are in computer code. DAOs are performed according to computer-coded rules (smart contracts), for example on a blockchain, and are subject to the joint work of their employees and members of the organization [[1]](https://libra.unine.ch/export/DL/40516.pdf).\r\nOn the 27. & 28 M\u00e4rz 2022 during the [Open Legal Lab] (https://challenges.openlegallab.ch/project/47) we created a legal structure for a DAO that will facilitate direct investments in PV-Systems in Switzerland that is Blockchain compatible and legally compliant.\r\n\r\n**Energy Communities**<p></p>\r\ne-swissolar AG believes that energy cooperatives are highly relevant for the energy transition. An energy cooperative is a non-profit organisation whose purpose is to locally produce and deliver renewable energy to its stakeholder or members. Members jointly own and democratically control the cooperative. Cooperatives around the world share the same seven principles, which are based on values such as democracy, equality and solidarity.\r\n\r\n Watch the video about the 7 cooperative principles:<br></br>\r\n<center><iframe width=\"400\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/xjlHRDWqOCo\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>\r\n\r\n **ReFi**<p></p>\r\n In 2021 in collaboration with the HSLU Institute of Innovation and Technology Management an Innocheque for e-swissolar\u2019s innovative idea ReFi -Regenerative Finance for Smart Energy Communities (54557.1 INNO-EE) has been conducted. ReFi is an investment platform built on top of a blockchain network that has the potential to efficiently and cost-effectively mobilise and redirect funds to small-scale projects owned by private persons or energy communities not eligible for traditional funding sources. Fractional ownership-enabled tokenisation and decentalised finance has the potential to unlock investment at various levels from retail investors to institutional investors with less risk due to a liquidity lending pool. This peer-to-contract (many-to-many) borrowing/lending scheme with blockchain yields a faster financing process with no underwriting and due diligence costs. ReFi offers transparency, collaboration and fair governance for domestic energy communities, public and private investors, and DSOs as a first step; with endless possibilities that can be built on top later. In 2021 e-swissolar developed a [prototype] (https://refi-near-hackathon.vercel.app/) deployed on the AURORA blockchain testnet.<p></p>\r\n**Distributed Autonomous Cooperative (DisCoo)**<p></p>\r\nWe are currently working on the development of the core architecture of the smart-contracts system and of the smart-contracts trying to build up a minimum prototype (backend) of a legally compliant decentralised autonomous cooperative. <p></p>More information will follow soon...<p></p>\r\n**Pilot**<p></p>\r\nMore information will follow soon...<p></p>\r\n##**Problem**\r\n**Financing**<p></p>\r\nA big barrier slowing the development of both new and existing energy communities is the lack of accessible, targeted and consistent funding and financing. [REScoop](https://www.rescoop.eu/toolbox/energy-communities-a-brief-explainer-for-managing-authorities-in-central-and-eastern-europe) identified following barriers:<p></p>\r\n- Limited access to bank financing and financing tools<p></p>\r\n- Lack of financing tools for initiating energy  communities<p></p>\r\n**Manage Stakeholders & Resources**<p></p>\r\nEnergy cooperatives are relaying on the active participation of citizens and the involvement of multiple stakeholders (local authorities, local\r\neconomic players, other cooperatives, etc.). Some citizens become members of the cooperatives, i.e. owners and users of the cooperative. Following challenges have been identified in this regard [REScoop](https://www.rescoop.eu/uploads/rescoop/downloads/REScoop-Guide-for-Stakeholder-Management.pdf):<p></p>\r\n- Organisation of members<p></p>\r\n- Information and transperancy<p></p>\r\n\r\n##**Solution**\r\n**Financing**<p></p>\r\n- Create specific financing tools for energy communities<p></p>\r\n\r\n**Manage Stakeholders & Resources**<p></p>\r\n- Innovative Tools for Governance<p></p>\r\n\r\n##**Challenge**\r\n\r\nIn the context of the identified problems and proposed solutions, what are the design criteria and patterns (elements) that constitute the SolarDAO. We will use the [DAO Canvas](https://daocanvas.webflow.io/) developed by Felipe Duarte.  The canvas is to guide groups through the process of making the most vital decisions they face in the process of imagining their DAO. We created a [miro-board](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOBjKN9w=/) where we will collectively work on the DAO canvas.

We also intend to deploy some new SM-powered IoT-Adapters to allow DSO-customers easy and reasonably inexpensive local access to their energy data. And we shall report on the issues encountered with MBUS-HDLC-DLMS-COSEM, DSMR and other types of CII.\r\n\r\nThe second part of the challenge shall investigate and show how the many EMS or smart-home systems (SHS like Loxone, KNX, Homeassistant, openHAB, ioBroker, and more) may obtain the energy-data by subscribing to the MQTT-broker.\r\n\r\nWe also intend to explore how to integrate the hourly next-day price forecast from ENTSO-E over MQTT. EMS, SHS or even the IoT-Adapters may display this information or take sensible load-shifting decisions to flatten their power use.\r\n\r\nBecause of much higher energy prices, PV system operatores may lose their previous economic incentive to use as much energy as possible from their own production for their local loads. Instead, local loads may be shifted to times of relativly lower energy prices which also nicely indicate less expected load.\r\n\r\n\ud83e\uddd1\ud83c\udffc\u200d\ud83c\udfeb Gantrisch Energie AG and Partner","maintainer":"","name":"Smart-Meter CII Interoperability with Smart-Home Systems","phase":"Verify","progress":20,"score":56,"source_url":"","stats":{"commits":0,"during":9,"people":0,"sizepitch":1705,"sizetotal":1828,"total":9,"updates":9},"summary":"Connect ten common smart meters to a data broker, establish a common information schema and develop apps and visualizations","team":"","team_count":0,"updated_at":"2022-09-19T15:30","url":"https://hack.energy.opendata.ch/project/100","webpage_url":"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vTF3A3VHD2p3GEuTTjUOtPiMa2_Xa8lwEanIp8WwLCM5buPI65LdESlGdz-o15ImgfSIqsDHBmjT7v7/embed?start=false&loop=false&slide=id.p25"},{"autotext":"","autotext_url":"","category_id":"","category_name":"","contact_url":"https://openenergydata.slack.com/archives/C042PEXUZA6","created_at":"2022-07-19T09:08","download_url":"","event_name":"Energy Data Hackdays 2022","event_url":"https://hack.energy.opendata.ch/event/7","excerpt":"Imagine the next generation of building modelling tool experiences\r\n\r\n<h2>Aim:</h2>\r\nTo develop new concept for how a user could interact with our heat demand estimation API.\r\n\r\n<h2>Idea:</h2>\r\nWe have good models of heat demands in buildings, but there are many possible ways we can bring this to users.

real-time data from aliunid, develop a simple algorithm/logic to estimate the current solar radiation (Wh/m2) from PV production data (kW).\r\n\r\nBased on the obtained radiation data and the public PV data (installed power according to https://map.geo.admin.ch/ and roof area information from https://www.uvek-gis.admin.ch/BFE/sonnendach/ ) simulate the PV production in real time.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Aim </h2>\r\nThe aim is to map the total photovoltaic (PV) power produced in Switzerland in real-time without measuring each PV power plant individually. To achieve this, we want to simulate the PV power of all registered PV plants with PV plants for which aliunid has real-time data available.\r\n\r\n<h2>Idea </h2>\r\nIt is safe to assume that two neighboring PV systems follow a very similar production curve. By measuring only one of them we could simulate the PV production of both. By extending this approach to the whole of Switzerland, the challenge is to simulate the PV output of all registered PV plants with data where aliunid already measures the real-time power output. The challenge consists of the following parts: \r\n1. Generate location-specific irradiance data based on measured PV output all over Switzerland. \r\n2. Apply the generated irradiance dataset to PV systems that are currently not measured based on basic information and open data (e.g., installed capacity, slope, orientation). \r\n3. Present the results (e.g., the total amount of PV power currently produced in Switzerland) on a map, dashboard, or similar. \r\n\r\n<h2>Big picture </h2>\r\nDecentral Photovoltaic (PV) systems can be found all over Switzerland and their impact on the Swiss energy system is becoming increasingly relevant. Real-time information about each PV system helps to maximize its use and mitigate potential negative impacts. \r\nWe will provide high-resolution data of the power output of PV systems all over Switzerland as well as historic weather data.

We have the real data and we are looking for data enthusiasts, who can crunch the data and generate some very interesting facts. How do we charge? How much energy do we actually need in order to cover our monthly mobility needs? Do people wait for low tariff or do they charge during the day? How does the typical charging profile look like? How about charging at work or at other points of interest (supermarkets etc.)? These and many more questions are waiting for your analytics skills and talent to be answered!\r\n\r\nData:\r\nOver two years of charging profiles (power consumption) timeseries in 15-minute resolution of more than 200 charging stations from the backend system of our e-mobility market product.\r\n\r\nAim:\r\nAnalyze the data set in order to visualize the behavior of e-mobility drivers, bust some myths and support arguments with facts.\r\n\r\nIdea:\r\nHere some interesting questions:\r\nHow do we charge?\r\nHow many people wait for low tariff?\r\nHow many people charge their cars right away when returning home?\r\nHow does the car\u2019s charging logic work? How many cars are waiting for early morning to be fully charged (when drive-off time is preset by the driver)?\r\nDo people charge every day or only when the batteries are empty?\r\nDo people charge always on the same day? On which day of the week do people mostly charge?\r\nTypical charging profiles\r\nHow does a typical charging profile look like?\r\nWhich patterns are the most important ones?\r\nPlace of charging\r\nHow different is the charging behavior at work or at other places of interest?\r\nThese and other questions need to be answered.\r\n\r\nBig Picture:\r\nAs the discussion around e-mobility grows, facts are needed to support assumptions, deepen our knowledge and help with the transition to an all-electric mobility world. Understanding the behavior of charging will help us not only better understand e-mobility as a whole, but could also open new horizons for products and services.\r\n\r\n\ud83e\uddd1\ud83c\udffc\u200d\ud83c\udfeb EKZ Angelos Selviaridis","maintainer":"","name":"E-Mobility Analytics","phase":"Verify","progress":20,"score":40,"source_url":"","stats":{"commits":0,"during":3,"people":3,"sizepitch":2665,"sizetotal":2776,"total":3,"updates":0},"summary":"As the discussion around e-mobility grows help with the transition to an all-electric mobility world is needed.","team":"nicola_ruch, andre_eggli, AbdullahShakil","team_count":3,"updated_at":"2022-09-19T15:32","url":"https://hack.energy.opendata.ch/project/106","webpage_url":"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vTF3A3VHD2p3GEuTTjUOtPiMa2_Xa8lwEanIp8WwLCM5buPI65LdESlGdz-o15ImgfSIqsDHBmjT7v7/embed?start=false&loop=false&slide=id.p13"},{"autotext":"","autotext_url":"","category_id":"","category_name":"","contact_url":"","created_at":"2022-09-17T13:42","download_url":"","event_name":"Energy Data Hackdays 2022","event_url":"https://hack.energy.opendata.ch/event/7","excerpt":"We walked around the town of [Brugg](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brugg) with a [Software-Defined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software-defined_radio) radio receiver and antenna, running open source software on a laptop to capture electromagnetic field emissions - observing the interplay of radio frequencies invisible to the eye or ear.

Noticing sensors, transformers, mobile phone antennas, and other sources of radio interference, we were also much more aware of the technology that surrounds us even within a short radius. Our aim is to passively observe the variety and mystery of the patterns that we encounter during our walk. With a bit of practice, we find interesting frequencies, and learn to localize sources of interference. We may start to \"see\" the city through a new lens, even though in our case it is just a 1-dimensional waterfall-like visualization called a [Spectrogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrogram).\r\n\r\n## What's next \ud83e\uddd1\ud83c\udffc\u200d\ud83c\udfeb \r\n\r\nWe planned our walk using swisstopo open data shown on the [GeoAdmin map](https://s.geo.admin.ch/9a773df8bc) shown below. Based on these locations of interesting sites, we are creating an [Actionbound](https://en.actionbound.com/) quest to visit the most interesting industrial sites around Brugg. We can recommend frequencies to tune into, such the ones typically emitted by public works.

The participants are expected to build on top of the research results, develop ways to incorporate social/occupants' behavior and build the foundation to design a game that would raise public awareness.\r\n\r\nIdea\r\n\r\n1) data-driven modeling of occupant behavior: In this challenge, we value the modeling of stochastic human behaviors. Given the digitalization of the energy systems, occupants' behavior is taking a more central role in designing automation and control systems. However, occupants are considered (and modeled) passive recipients of the control system to date. To obtain a more realistic assessment of occupants' interaction with building automation and control, this task shall model occupants as active agents that react and occasionally override control decisions, forcing their preferences into the building operation, which the controller has to deal with as disturbance.\r\n \r\n2) if time permits, design a game framework based on the digital twin and the developed human twin: Energy end-users are currently taking a passive role in the energy transition. However, they have a much higher impact by changing their behaviors. For example, lowering thermal comfort voluntarily during extremely cold weather would help the energy system to avoid using fossil fuel-based energy production. This awareness may be raised by playing games where people interact and observe their impacts. Our open-source digital twin supports an open-source game for such a purpose. Code is appreciated, but conceptual level development is also sufficient.\r\n \r\nBig picture\r\n\r\nBuilding energy demand accounts for a large share of global energy consumption and carbon emission. Advanced building energy management systems can help to reduce energy consumption and carbon footprint. Although the technical design has been much investigated, the impacts of occupant behaviors are rarely considered. In addition, occupants\u2019 behavior can be influenced by great awareness of their impacts and contribution to the energy transition.\r\n\r\nSee also: https://github.com/khayatian/nestli\r\n\r\nKeywords: game design, machine learning, social behavior\r\n\r\n\ud83e\uddd1\ud83c\udffb\u200d\ud83c\udfeb EMPA Philipp Heer, Cai Hanmin, Khayatian Fazel\r\nAppreciated skills/background: python/game design/data analytics/social science\r\n\r\n","maintainer":"","name":"Gamification of building energy performance with human digital twins","phase":"Ask","progress":0,"score":0,"source_url":"","stats":{"commits":0,"during":2,"people":0,"sizepitch":2405,"sizetotal":2512,"total":2,"updates":2},"summary":"Playing games where people interact and observe their impacts for data-driven modeling of occupant behavior","team":"","team_count":0,"updated_at":"2022-09-19T15:31","url":"https://hack.energy.opendata.ch/project/112","webpage_url":"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vSHdxvvPVwUKo8ehuaoN2CkVPNvRLls_OF1sZz3dVU0XurOmtP3FI7bKSf6KWA0vA/embed?start=false"}],"name":"projects"}],"sources":[{"path":"https://dribdat.cc","title":"dribdat"}],"title":"Energy Data Hackdays 2022","version":"0.2.0"}
