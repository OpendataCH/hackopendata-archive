In one thousand of the houses in 1910 there was some kind of bar or restaurant (a.k.a. 'Bierhalle' or 'Trinkstube') included, which means in almost every 10th building! Lots of these establishments were located in the corner house of a block and lots of them can be seen and identified in Ruef-Hirts photographs. Names and locations of the restaurants can be found in the old adress books of the city (a very useful source for historical Research by any means), see: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12cnmRlf_PUZ1Jb9aWpKqHwi-tuVRIWUg?usp=sharing (unfortunately not fully online digital yet).\r\n\r\nContact:\r\nSaro Pepe Fischer, Baugeschichtliches Archiv der Stadt Z\u00fcrich, Neumarkt 4, 8001 Z\u00fcrich | saro.pepefischer@zuerich.ch\r\n\r\n\r\n![Title](https://bucketeer-036aa605-c047-4623-8610-f1764b90cf98.s3.amazonaws.com/glamhack/C5JJXKZGGFX12MIOBX5ICX4C.jpg)\r\n\r\n![Title](https://bucketeer-036aa605-c047-4623-8610-f1764b90cf98.s3.amazonaws.com/glamhack/7P8VKG7USXVFFLNOVW5ZZML8.jpg)\r\n<p>\r\n---\r\n<b> Project Documentation (work in progress): </b>\r\n\r\n<b>Friday, 16.4.2021 // </b><br>\r\n11:00h:  Group forming.<br>\r\nTeam members:<br>\r\nSaro Pepe Fischer<br>\r\nElias Kreyenbuehl<br>\r\nJan Sandberg<br>\r\nMichel Piguet<br>\r\nKenny Floria<p><p>\r\n\r\n13:00h: First tests with implementing the historical Pics of Ruef-Hirt in maps and 3D applications:<br>\r\n\r\n![Title](https://bucketeer-036aa605-c047-4623-8610-f1764b90cf98.s3.amazonaws.com/glamhack/QPW49YSKFHWQAY504RWV3MHY.jpg)\r\n<br>\r\n![Title](https://bucketeer-036aa605-c047-4623-8610-f1764b90cf98.s3.amazonaws.com/glamhack/HVIYX6QA83GEUQKFGHJDKR5I.jpg)\r\n<br>\r\n![Title](https://bucketeer-036aa605-c047-4623-8610-f1764b90cf98.s3.amazonaws.com/glamhack/JRUZ9ST1M0W8TBGBJMJL9WRH.jpg)\r\n<p>\r\n15:00h: Decision to narrow the project down to the city's quarter \"Aussersihl Inustrie\" and especially the \"Langstrasse\".\r\n<p>\r\n15:45h: A first milestone, this newly generated map with the historical pictures: <br>\r\nhttp://glamhack21.kennyfloria.ch/<p>\r\nCode to the map-/picture-application: <br>\r\nhttps://github.com/PaulKC/glamhack2021-a-walk-trough-zurich-around-1910<p><p>\r\n16:30h: Remodelling pictures for integration in a 3D-view:<p>\r\n\r\n![Title](https://bucketeer-036aa605-c047-4623-8610-f1764b90cf98.s3.amazonaws.com/glamhack/DZX836MPTENC4I8EISCKQIX1.jpg)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n![Title](https://bucketeer-036aa605-c047-4623-8610-f1764b90cf98.s3.amazonaws.com/glamhack/548Q7J6ONTP7EEXVI49EIX14.jpg)\r\n<br>\r\n![Title](https://bucketeer-036aa605-c047-4623-8610-f1764b90cf98.s3.amazonaws.com/glamhack/LVMWNJW9FFNIMRVTHTDOR0TO.jpg)\r\n<p>\r\n22:30h: Implementing the 1913 city map as a new background:<p>\r\n\r\n![Title](https://bucketeer-036aa605-c047-4623-8610-f1764b90cf98.s3.amazonaws.com/glamhack/L2NKKW8FNSSDWV4QH914P3YX.jpg)\r\n\r\n![Title](https://bucketeer-036aa605-c047-4623-8610-f1764b90cf98.s3.amazonaws.com/glamhack/EZH94OOBA0K83B0BQPHDRVAQ.jpg)\r\n<p>\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Saturday, 17.4.2021 // </b><p>\r\n09:30h: Presentation of the implementing of the 3D-model of the City of Zurich (real Buildings) for the filmic walk through \"Langstrasse 1906\":<br>\r\n\r\n![Title](https://bucketeer-036aa605-c047-4623-8610-f1764b90cf98.s3.amazonaws.com/glamhack/LKBKB7PM1NFHPHZ1LTXWE6XB.jpg)<br>\r\n![Title](https://bucketeer-036aa605-c047-4623-8610-f1764b90cf98.s3.amazonaws.com/glamhack/S3OMVC1UTE0DILBFXPUEEBLP.jpg)<br>\r\n![Title](https://bucketeer-036aa605-c047-4623-8610-f1764b90cf98.s3.amazonaws.com/glamhack/LL2LINFV430YMAOW8CCUJ58D.jpg)\r\n<br>\r\n![Title](https://bucketeer-036aa605-c047-4623-8610-f1764b90cf98.s3.amazonaws.com/glamhack/W7YOID6SVFA88268AGL73UM3.jpg)<p>\r\n13:30h-15:00h: Fighting the video programmes and trying to render, edit and export the files.

Culture inTime was first developed during GLAMhack 2020. A few features have been added: \n* Anyone with the right skills can now add their own SPARQL queries of existing linked open data (LOD) sources\n* Anyone can now configure their own Spotlights based on data sources in Culture inTime\n\nCulture inTime continues to put its focus on Performing Arts Productions. Go to https://culture-intime-2.herokuapp.com/ to try it out!\n\nTypes of Users\n=========================\n* Power User: Can create SPARQL queries and Spotlights on data.\n* Spotlight Editor: Creates Spotlights on data. \n* Browser: Uses Search functionality and pre-configured Spotlights to peruse data. \n\nData Sources\n=========================\nIn the section called Data Sources, power users can add their own SPARQL queries of existing linked open data (LOD) sources to Culture inTime. The only prerequisties are:\n* Technical expertise in creating SPARQL queries\n* Knowledge of the graph you want to query\n* Login credentials (open to all) \n\nTwo types of SPARQL queries can be added to Culture inTime\n* Queries to add names of Performing Arts Productions. These queries are limited to the performing arts production title and basic premiere information.\n* Queries to add supplementary data that augments specific productions. Supplementary data can be things like event dates, performers, related reviews and juxtaposed data (examples are indigenous territorial mappings, cultural funding statistics).  Supplementary queries are loaded on the fly and always attached to one or more Performing Arts Production queries.\nTo learn more about how to add queries, see the Technical Guide.\n\nDifferent contributors are continuously adding and building on data sources. To see what's been added, go to https://culture-intime-2.herokuapp.com/data_sources.\n\n\nSpotlights\n=========================\nSpotlights group together productions around a theme. They can span time, locations and data sources. Once you create a login, creating spotlights is easy with a new form that allows Spotlight Editors to choose their parameters and then share their spotlight with the community. Basic editorial functionality is available. To see some Spotlights, go to https://culture-intime-2.herokuapp.com/spotlights.\n\n![Spotlight Page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saumier/GLAMhack2020-Culture-inTime/master/images/Spotlight.png)\n\nTechnical Guide\n========================\nTo add Spolights or a new data source using SPARQL, please consult this [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ht17HeUmt-TXJIk139XP4usTn1AV5boWFoSmFw53q-w/edit?usp=sharing) \n\nGLAMHACK 2020\n=========================\nThis 2020 GlamHack Challenge resulted from the discussions we had earlier this week during the workshops related to performing arts data and our goal is to create a Linked Open Data Ecosystem for the Performing Arts.\n\nSome of us have been working on this for years, focusing mostly on data cleansing and data publication.\nNow, the time has come to shift our focus towards creating concrete applications that consume data from different sources.\nThis will allow us to demonstrate the power of linked data and to start providing value to users.\nAt the same time, it will allow us to tackle issues related to data modelling and data federation based on concrete use cases.\n\n\u201cCulture InTime\u201d is one such application. It is a kind of universal cultural calendar, which allows us to put the Spotlight on areas and timespans where coherent sets of data have already been published as linked data. At the same time, the app fetches data from living data sources on the fly. And as more performing arts data is being added to these data sources, they will automatically show up.\nIt can:\n- Provide a robust listing of arts and cultural events, both historical and current. Audiences are able to search for things they are interested in, learn more about performing arts productions and events, find new interests, et cetera.\n- Reduce duplication of work in area of data entry\n\nThe code is a simple as possible to demonstrate the potential of using LOD (structured data) to create a calendar for arts and cultural events that is generated from data in Wikidata and the [Artsdata.ca](http://artsdata.ca) knowledge graph. \n\nThe user interface is designed to allow visitors to search for events. They can:\n- Use the Spotlight feature to quickly view events grouped by theme.\n- Use Time Period buttons to search a time period.\n- Use a Search field to enter a search using the following criteria: name of production, theatre, city, or country.\n- Visit the source of the data to learn more (in the example of an Artsdata.ca event, Click Visit Event Webpage to be redirected to the Arts Organization website.\n\nNote: Currently when you enter a location, data only exists for Switzerland and Canada (country), Zurich, Montreal/Laval/Toronto/Vancouver/Fredericton and some small villages in Quebec.  \n\nSearch results list events sorted by date.\n\n\nChallenges\n=========================\nData is modelled differently in Wikidata, Artsdata, and even between projects within the same database.\nData has very few images.\n\nMore UI Images\n=========================\nSpotlight Page\n\n![Spotlight Page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saumier/GLAMhack2020-Culture-inTime/master/images/Spotlight.png)\n\nEvent Details page - Montreal\n\n![Production Details](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saumier/GLAMhack2020-Culture-inTime/master/images/ProductionDetails.png)\n\nProduction Details page - Zurich\n\n![Production Details](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saumier/GLAMhack2020-Culture-inTime/master/images/ProductionDetails-Schauspielhaus-Zurich.png)\n","autotext_url":"https://github.com/culturecreates/Culture-inTime","category_id":"","category_name":"","contact_url":"https://github.com/culturecreates/Culture-inTime/issues","created_at":"2021-04-09T15:39","download_url":"","event_name":"GLAMhack 2021","event_url":"https://hack.glam.opendata.ch/event/2","excerpt":"GLAMhack 2021 - Culture inTime \n=========================\n\nGLAMhack 2021 provided the opportunity to continue working on Culture inTime, a sandbox for adding and visualizing Performing Arts Production metadata in a simple calendar-like user interface.

The tutorials shall cover a broad range of topics, providing simple explanations for beginners in several languages. The tutorials will be gathered on a website, where users can either look for specific instructions or go through the whole programme of tutorials. In this perspective, we have created a storyboard going from a general introduction to the usefulness of Wikidata for GLAMs to tutorials explaining how to edit specific information. \r\n\r\nThe tutorials are based on powerpoint presentations with audio tracks. We have prepared a template to facilitate the tutorial production during the hackathon. We also have scripts for some of the topics. We will be using applications such as deepl to automatically translate the scripts. With the use of \u201ctext to speech\u201d converters, we will record the scripts in English, French, German and Italian. This will allow us to produce many tutorials in the short time span of the GLAMhack. \r\n\r\nA second aspect of our project consists in producing a short video as an introduction to our website. This video should explain what kind of information is registered about GLAMs in Wikidata and what benefits the institutions can draw from the database. \r\n\r\nWe are looking for participants who are interested in sharing their Wikidata knowledge, people who have experience with fun and easy tutorials, people who know wordpress to work on the website, polyglots who can edit the automatically generated translations or people without any Wikidata know-how who want to help us develop the user journey of our tutorial programme by trying it out.

Convoluted structure and formatting errors were rather demotivating. Nevertheless it influenced our thoughts about a &quot;demoscene data standard&quot;, and brainstorm ideas of improving overall data quality (for example, we immediately noticed mismatched dates and missing values).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/vMPy7JL.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<p>This API was also recently used to do some terrific <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pouetdotnet/status/1345056403338231808\">data analysis</a>, and we reached out to the authors to find out if we can reuse their scripts. We have also reached out via the <a href=\"https://discord.com/channels/534447164043165696/534975603573522433/832566846016323584\">#pouet Discord</a> for guru meditation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Hckf04U.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<h3>demozoo</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Demozoo API is basic but usable: http://demozoo.org/api/v1/\r\nAs it&#39;s a paginated web service, it would require a bit of scraping code to aggregate. So we used the &#39;nuclear option&#39; of getting the <a href=\"http://data.demozoo.org/demozoo-export.sql.gz\">database dump</a> in raw SQL format. Importing this into a local SQLite database (inspired by <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/mlc9gv/updated_ive_saved_all_of_wikipedia_into_a_sqlite/\">all of Wikipedia in SQLite</a>) and then re-exported the tables in CSV format.

We did some research to see what effort in this direction was already made, and reached out to the Demozoo and Pouet communities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each of the data sources have a schema of their own, and some attempts at consolidation have been made. We started with a simplified version of the Demozoo model, created a <a href=\"https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/table-schema/\">Table Schema</a> which can be used for validation or annotation as <a href=\"http://json-schema.org/specification.html\">JSON Schema</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://demozoo.org/productions/38800/\"><img src=\"https://media.demozoo.org/screens/s/44/0e/ad34.jw63527.png%20=320x240\" alt=\"Ascii Attack by Latex\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<h3>repository</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Our dataset repository clearly explains its sources, but also points out there are many other places which could be future data acquisition targets. These notable scene repositories and data sources include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>https://demozoo.org/ (as above)</li>\r\n<li>https://pouet.net/ (as above)</li>\r\n<li>https://csdb.dk/</li>\r\n<li>https://zxart.ee/</li>\r\n<li>https://ada.untergrund.net/</li>\r\n<li>https://files.scene.org/</li>\r\n<li>https://www.demoparty.net/</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://demozoo.org/productions/95633/\"><img src=\"https://media.demozoo.org/screens/s/d9/ea/5a60.85932.png\" alt=\"Dump V1.71 by Dead Hackers Society\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<h3>service</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>While the Data Package is nice to look at in it&#39;s JSON glory, most people (and programmers) will want some kind of interface to it. We wrote a small server using the <a href=\"https://falconframework.org/\">Falcon Framework</a> to produce a barebones API. Since the data is loaded using a Frictionless Data wrapper for the <a href=\"https://pandas.pydata.org/\">Pandas library</a>, it can incorporate various advanced sorting and filtering routines. Our proto-service is currently running at a private VPS hosted on Linode, but should also work on &#39;lambda function&#39; hosts like Vercel or Heroku.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://demozoo.org/productions/43074/\"><img src=\"https://media.demozoo.org/screens/s/64/8c/4c76.36647.jpg\" alt=\"Dream by Vantage\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/oWCONsZ.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still from <a href=\"https://demozoo.org/productions/120261/\">Traffic Jam by Chainsaw</a> </p>\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<h3>prototype</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>If we make it this far, we would like to make a basic example of data usage. After all this data wrangling, we didn&#39;t have time to really explore the space of user interface possibilities.

More than 20,000 comments are received annually in the image archive and are incorporated into the metadata (see also our blog \"Crowdsourcing\"). \r\n\r\nHowever, the metadata on Wikimedia Commons is not updated and is therefore sometimes outdated, imprecise or even incorrect.

The globe is a magnificent manifestation of the world concept of the late 16th century. The modern (for its time) cartographical knowledge, representation of current (i.e. contemporary) and historical events and diverse mirabilia combined with its overwhelming size and opulent paint job certainly led it to be a \u201cconversational piece\u201d wherever it was exhibited. \r\n\r\nEven though it is a fully functional earth and celestial globe regarding its size and elaborative decorative artistry, it is assumed that the globe was more of a prestigious showpiece than a scientific instrument. \r\nThe globe's full splendor is best appreciated by exploring the original at the Landesmuseum Z\u00fcrich or its replica in the Stiftsbibliothek St. Gallen.

Fortunately the ETH Institute of Geodesy and Photogrammetry made a high resolution 3D prototype available for both the original and the replica globe (Low Resolution Preview: https://hbzwwws04.uzh.ch/occusense/sg_globus.php).\r\n\r\nCombined with the rich expertise around the St. Galler Globus we want to create digital concepts of how we could make the St. Galler Globus\u2019 narratives and historical context accessible to a broader audience interested in \u201cScientainment\u201d. \r\nWe are looking for people who want to create digital prototypes, write and visualize narratives, conceptualize interactive experiences or find other ways to show the rich narratives of the St. Galler Globus.\r\n\r\nWith those concepts we want to show the potential inherent in exhibiting a digital version of the St. Galler Globus. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPasswords to the sources: Magnetberg\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","maintainer":"josbin","name":"St. Galler Globus","phase":"Research","progress":10,"score":49,"source_url":"https://drive.switch.ch/index.php/s/IFxZJRxAe48NOh5","stats":{"commits":0,"during":3,"people":4,"sizepitch":2038,"sizetotal":2107,"total":15,"updates":10},"summary":"Conceptualizing Interactive Narratives for a \"Scientainment\" Audience","team":"josbin, Stefan, lschmitt, adrian_funk","team_count":4,"updated_at":"2021-04-17T14:31","url":"https://hack.glam.opendata.ch/project/65","webpage_url":"https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lN1sIuU=/"},{"autotext":"","autotext_url":"","category_id":"","category_name":"","contact_url":"","created_at":"2021-04-09T12:21","download_url":"","event_name":"GLAMhack 2021","event_url":"https://hack.glam.opendata.ch/event/2","excerpt":"The Zentralbibliothek Zurich and several other Libraries in Switzerland own large numbers of music scores.

A large number of them stems from various places in Europe \u2013 from northern Scandinavia to the South of Greece, from Portugal to the Carpathians, from remote Alps to bustling cities.

They came into the museum\u2019s collection as acquisitions or gifts during the last 120 years.\r\n\r\nWhile in the very beginning the focus of the collectors was on objects from remote Swiss hamlets, the interest slowly shifted to artefacts from industrialised environments. Changing geopolitical developments enabled collecting in different regions of Europa at different times. Also, personal interests or personal connections of single collectors led to sudden large additions from one specific area.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this challenge is to show the rise and fall of dominant geographical provenances during the last 120 years of collecting in Europe. This could enable the answer to interesting questions such as: Which specific spatial interests arose and fell during the last 120 years? How did the idea of Europe\u2019s border change over time? When was the peak of collecting in remote Swiss valleys? Which were the effects of the First and the Second World War on the geographical provenance of new acquisition? How did the fall of the Iron Curtain affect the collection practice?\r\n\r\nThe data provided by MKB has never been published before. It stems from a database used for managing the collection, which grew over generations. There are inconsistencies on different levels, as errors and omissions occurred both when the objects were first cataloged and when the catalogues were transcribed into the database.

Personal empowerment, thanks to mass adoption of the user & context relevant best practices, \n- via human-centric access to digital apps, with TRUST being built:\n- by seamless mass dissemination of indiviDUAL BENEFICIAL digital behaviour habit: visual access to the secure MyData-interface\n- to API's of Mydata-certified Operators / public service operators / public health operators (MyData-IHAN, SITRA Project, Finland)\n- enabled by taking responsibility of the approval of the 'best practices' by global expert community of MyData.org\n- in cases of lacking public service of approval / choice of the 'best practice'. \nE.g.: choice in EU among several available COVID-19 infected Contact Tracing apps.\n\nTool: MyData IndiviDUALbooks, for under-served people, rescue &amp; learning; 'MyData best practices' dissemination service, B2CoOp2C. \nWhen knowledge sources are not accessible (e.g. closed by pandemic; paywalled; marginalized; privacy harming),\n\nsecure &amp; trusted communication between experts &amp; citizen is paramount: \nvia UpCode/DUAL stickers of IndiviDUALbook/oeBook (Open Europe book), on-demand SECURELY printed, for safe P2P cycling beyond Public Libraries/PL: without (costly for taxpayer) librarians manual jobs.\n\nOur solution for MASS dissemination combines several sub-systems (1-8), each may function (or not) also autonomously, \nimproving life quality\n- and their combination enables seamless, human-centric access to the Learning's 'best practices', \n- indiviDUALly i.e. via human senses AND via digital twins, tools of subsystem's products.\n\nA physical, haptic-friendly UNIQUE oeBook is home delivered in hours (with the expert advices, human-readable & machine-readable/by scan at UpCode sticker), \nengaging even digitally illiterate users by human-centric & optimal learning (paper) form factor, associated with TRUSTED (PL) experiences,\n\nrelevant to context of the unique user/'crisis patient': see slides 16, 28 of oeBooks presentation\n\nhttps://bit.ly/oeBookSlides4Aalto;\n\nwatch 2 minutes video of #HackTheCrisisFinland https://vimeo.com/399509367.\n\nNB: oeBooks are less costly than via legacy business models of book production & distribution. \n\nSubsystems (1-8):\n\n(1) MyData.org, a non-profit organization, the umbrella, uniting expert communities for ETHICAL human-centric data processing;\n\ntakes the responsibility to deliver to global users the experts' choice of a 'best practice', in context of user's data & event.\n\n(2) MyData Global cooperative (pending form, like a platform cooperative / PPP), a MyData Case Library\n\nhttps://mydata.org/cases/ ;\n\nOpen Accessible (via PL networks / MyData Cooperative Operators) for any cooperative member, as a grassroots movement for personal dignity, in hyper-connected world.\n\nThis service's business model is B2CoOp2C / Business to Cooperative Operator to Consumer;\n\nBusiness to (MyData) Cooperative Operator to Consumer: sub-divison of Collective framework of service Governance in human-centric way.\n\nAn indvidual may authorize an algorithm to choose MyData Operator\u2019s API by a context (via seamless access to a MyData Operator\u2019s API, e.g. by a click at the MyData logo, enhanced as-a-button). \nThe choice of a context is enabled by choice of an interface by an individual (a seamless choice / MyData responsibility: \nan individual is nudged to a certain interface type, by MyData logo-button) - relevant to an event & user need. \nIt's a choice of a certain type of QR-code to access services, among open source Data Matrix (GDPR & Open Access-conform) / proprietary Data Matrix (GDPR-conform, but not Open Source) / opposite to a 'US/Chinese surveillance' QR-code type (like ChiQR, that is not GDPR-conform, but is sneaking into use in EU).\n\n(3) PL networks and resources, including the collaborating non-public libraries & knowledge containers, like University libraries etc. (e.g. Finna.fi; Europeana.eu);\n\nenable accumulation of knowledge resources, to be assessed / peer reviewed / suggested to end-user delivery, by sub-systems (1-2).\n\n(4) UpCodeworld.com, http://linker.upcode.net/files/Upcode/Upcode.pdf, THE method to make intelligent solutions to improve processes by handling rich data with AI;\n\nenabling Edge AI processing (never missing a user-controlled processor) of Knowledge & Learning data, \nleveraging Smart tags as links for any data with personal rights and values (intrinsic & extrinsic).\n\nSmart tags can work on- and off-line solution, storing private data on citizens mobile device. This data is protected by disposable-id which can be used to build two-sided trust. \nCitizen creates disposable ID with their photo and selected credentials. Then this ID is used to create eWallet where all data is encrypted either by public or private key. Citizen can proof their identity to third party by showing their UpCode & photo which are stored in local storage. When data is transferred to users ewallet is encrypted and only user can open it. This data transfer is contactless and uses UpCode's as data stream. Data sender can then be sure that data can only be read by receiver and also that receiver is who they pretend to be.  \nPossible uses cases are virtual+paper (DUAL) books, evouchers and healtcare solutions.\n\nUpCode coordinates this project.\n\n(5) MyData IndiviDUALbooks, PL paper books, on- & off-line enriched by products of subsystems (1-4);\n\nfor ubiquity and Online2Offline-protection of 'best practices' Smart tags-as-carriers of societal penetration & mass dissemination;\n\noeBooks 1-pager: https://bit.ly/IndiviDUALbooks4FLA1pager.\n\n(6) ScanTORI, The habit & The method of MIRO (My Interaction with Relevant Objects; like recording of mirror reflections data);\nby looking/scanning at the TOp RIght (TORI) corner of physical or virtual objects, mass-placed at what3words.com axes intersections;\n\nrecording time&place changes of human 'glance directions' / scans of inter-positions of ethical 'best practice's tags;\n\nat user's memex-like Edge processors, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex, by MyData Global Edge AI operators - per subsystem (2);\n\nfor user's contextual (seamless, human senses friendly) control of interactions between end-user and the surrounding Smart tags;\n\nthus quick-delivering the context-related 'best practice', improving life quality. \n\nThis method may leverage DHID/DP3T findings, with or without utilizing BLE data \n(https://github.com/disposableidentities/healthcrisis/blob/master/README.md),\n\nalso without need of smartphones - phone BLE data may be superseded by Li-Fi - for wider engaging under-served groups of population, \n\nfor raising 'best practices' penetration to 60+% of population: leveraging (3) PL networks actual ubiquity in developed/EU countries; \n\nand by adding penetration by 'non-library patrons' money use cases: subsystem (4) offers improvement of purchasing practices via incentivized e-wallets; \nas well as co-engages by a wide spectrum of UpCode-improved user experiences at daily situations in work-learning-leisure paradigm \n(watch 2 minutes from 13:00 https://vimeo.com/11292000).\n\nPL patrons = 20% in EU to 40% in Finland (excluding non-reading babies 2,5%; non-curable for library/impaired groups 5%);\n\n60% regular usage is needed for efficiency of 'best practices' dissemination, e.g. for contact tracing, via DHID/DP3T;\n\nHow it works (virtual notes of 'virtual eye-contact' data are sent by 1click/Li-Fi or BLE 'glance' at PERSONAL, but ANONYMOUS sticker's UpCode, from a local library oeBook - to Personal Data Stores/PDS, managed by MyData Operator, like Personium.io, to the nearest what3words.com axis'/w3w axis' intersections/Edges; Open Source version of anonymous data locations nearby: 'My PDS is 3 meters away, at w3w axis cross' https://whatfreewords.net/demo/) - see comments to Slide 4 https://bit.ly/oeBookPPT.\n\n(7) what3words.com geo-location grid subsystem;\n\nenabling human senses dimension involvement to machine readable geo-data;\n\nenriched by 'the 3rd coordinate' of interactions angle-of-sight, from subsystems (5-6).\n\n(8) Li-Fi, the wireless communication technology which utilizes light to transmit data and position between devices;\n\nenabling co-working of subsystems (1-7), in collaboration and autonomously.\n\nDeliverables and impact of the project\n\nCosts saving by libraries  \nCosts of library manual work are partially eliminated by the proposed solution. Manual work for at least 10% of books, that will be enhanced by Accessible Formats, for Visually Impaired People (for e.g. 10% of 300 M \u20ac taxpayer costs of Finland public libraries) will be replaced via the business model of \u0152books: Peer-to-Peer \u0152books & context data exchange via on-demand localized printing, BEYOND PL walls.   \nPlastic lamination replacement in libraries  \nTo-date new book manual wrapping by plastic dust cover takes approximately 3 min., produces harmful waste. Instead of plastic lamination of books, a multi-layer folded paper dust cover will be produced by on-demand printer. Wear-resistive, eco-materials for \u0152book covers are designed by SmartPaper.fi, for producers like 3M, in USA & Germany; Paptic OY + Woodly Oy, in collaboration with VTT, FIN; FoFi, CH.   \nIncreasing the amount of library loans by 8-10%  \nOur solution will provide access to reserved, but unavailable books, by enabling on-demand last mile printing. Book authors will be informed of the royalty fee, in the 1click-moment of \u0152book exchange, via e.g. in Finland public fund Sanasto. This solution raises social inclusion, incentivizing more visits to library book cafes (when pandemic ends) & Peer-to-Peer book sharing (during pandemic, with 24-hours book quarantine via unmanned \u2018Minilibrary\u2019: watch 2-minutes video https://vimeo.com/399509367); will cut personal data abuse, by NGI use/ ETHICAL digital services, library patrons, for 50+% of Finns, & EU-wide.  \nMinimizing waste, saving energy costs  \nOn-demand printed \u0152book can be kept by patron forever, leveraging co-ownership of \u0152book; in1click sent to recycling or shared via Postal service\u2019s (e.g. Litteri.net; Posti.fi; Helmet Pocket Library) mobile application, thus saving public libraries & publishers relative costs vs \u2018traditional\u2019 book processing (manual ABC-shelving jobs, sorting lines inside library AND INSIDE Postal/ inter-library logistics, retail).  \nPersonalized healing: reading issue of Visually Impaired, illiterate, digitally excluded; vs virus contagion \nReduced costs of personalized treatment (of reading issues; ANONYMOUS infection contact tracing), via PDS at \u0152books, will enable accessibility to more learning & healing resources, thus reducing suffer from a.m. issues. Library \u0152books ubiquity will enable ubiquity of ethical access to The Web, via NGI.  \nThe new building blocks of our service to contribute open hardware and software ecosystems growth   \nWe help to Open Science / PlanS; Europeana Open Culture projects READ, GIFT: by our access model #Host3Books4PlanS, for University students' volunteer book scanning, one free book/GIFT.eu project, for 1 hour scan activities (ca. per scanned 3-4 books). Our Open SW partners are NGO\u2019s: MyData Global (I'm Founding Member), Open Knowledge Finland (I'm layman auditor); for Opening library loans Data/ LibDat.fi. Open HardWare: we promote Espresso Book Machine / EBM global network model - a book is self-produced by a (VIP) user, locally. Our innovation, RISO book finishing printer inside EBM: x 10 speed. \nWe leverage open source tech for security & privacy. Among these technologies (& proprietary tech\u2122): \n- Books on-demand printing, EU: e.g. at Rotomail, Milan, since 2010; Otava, Finland - since 2019 - Digital print, BookOfOne production at \u2018last mile\u2019/near user: \u2018Espresso Book Machines\u2019, at RISO - Book flexible covers production: light & robust multi-layered eco-paper for book dust jackets / SMARTpaper.fi envelope perforated tags, opened by pulling thread straps: for 1click book retour* - 2D-coding of printed media for (1) machine-readable tasks and (2) naked-eye/ visual engagement   - Adding VoicEye codes for audio-books, it makes up to A3 size pages speak = human sense friendly: oeBook produces audio, offline, for free, via 2D-codes (VoicEye.com) printed at every second page (\u2122proprietary technology of VoicEye; no such level of encryption tech is market available) - UpCode\u2122 Tags Management/ Mobile Access & Interaction\u2122(\u2122proprietary technology of UpCode; no similar level of security is market available); and Open Source TagItSmart\u2122 methods - Pressure Seal technology of SMARTpaper.fi forms, for 3M converting lines, Germany (Post-It stickers) - MyData approach, per GDPR: human-centric personal data usage, controlled by data subject - Copyright royalty 1click flow: Creative Passport, copy-for-own-use & Marrakesh Treaty: \u201cminority wins\u201d - OpenKnowledge.org & MyData.org expertise: AI Ethics, Codes of Conduct for human-centric data. \n-  Best digital practices of MyData Operators, 1click-accessible via NGI; including \u2018Europeana.eu ScanTent\u2019, FAIR data: via UpCode MAI\u2122 at PL & ABC https://www.accessiblebooksconsortium.org/publishing/en/  We are committed to make all Project publications available under the Creative Commons BY 4.0 licence. \n                                  ##Impact. Addressable Markets: population groups (A) + (B)  \n(A) PL patrons NOW = 20% average in EU; 40% in Finland (excluding non-reading babies 2,5%; noncurable for library/impaired groups 5%) + would grow thanks to oeBooks growing availability  (B) + 19% (20% less 1%) Visually Impaired People/VIP in EU (WHO statistics VIP=20%, incl. dyslexia); 1% receive AF books NOW (i.e. lack Societal Inclusion, Access-to-Learning) in Accessible Formats (AF are demanded by Accessibility law), due to legacy, outdated technologies of AF books production & distribution, like audio books in Finland, eBooks world over vs oeBooks/AF-twins*.                     \nWe address EACH of VIP & non-VIP: (s)he \u2018twins\u2019 book into her unique copy, curing unique issue.                                    \nThis project aims to grow to 60% (A+B) regular usage** of personal data services, measurable via UpCode; 60% assessed as efficient for 'best practices' dissemination, e.g. for contact tracing, via DHID/DP3T.

In this way, the works could be visualised according to their original position on a three-dimensional, interactive map.\r\n\r\nAdditionnaly, three-dimensional scans could also be an option to make the experience more immersive.\r\nSimple 3D scans can be created with the iPhone 12, with Kinect or from several perspective photographs.\r\n\r\nExample: https://www.instagram.com/reel/CMnM22DhTDm/\r\n\r\n\u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\r\n\r\nApproach 02:\r\nMultidimensional Publication | Conservation at the location (Information centered storytelling)\r\n[images 02-\u2026]\r\n\r\nThe works of Harald N\u00e4geli are embedded in a digital mediation format.\r\nSimilar to the website \"Leviathan Cycle\", created by OK RM, it is possible to work with the space and the positions of the works in the underground car park. Therefore a map could be used to navigate between the artworks.\r\n\r\nExample: https://leviathan-cycle.com/\r\n\r\nAnother possibility could be to generate additional layers of content to enrich the slim data-set. Possible content could be soundscapes of the underground car park, image descriptions, historical backgrounds or personal inputs.\r\n\r\nExample: https://www.eguide.ch/\r\n\r\n\u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\r\n\r\nApproach 03:\r\nH\u00f6hleneinwohner on the Road | Augmented Reality App\r\n[images 03-\u2026]\r\n\r\nAR application that places N\u00e4geli's \"H\u00f6hleneinwohner\" in three-dimensional space. Users of the app can virtually attach N\u00e4geli's works to walls in public or private spaces and photograph/film them.\r\nThe app detects surfaces and angles in the room allowing N\u00e4geli's \"H\u00f6hleneinwohner\" to be placed in the correct perspective in the scene. In this way, the art can continue to exist digitally beyond its actual lifetime on the walls of the ETH garage .\r\n\r\nThe spray work can be isolated with a tool such as Runway ml https://runwayml.com/green-screen/ and rendered as an augmented reality experience using the user's camera.\r\n\r\nExample: \r\n\u00abWeltformat\u00bb App by Maximage\r\nand Milk Interactive, which observes its surroundings\r\nfor grids and to place letters in them.\r\nhttps://apps.apple.com/ch/app/weltformat/id1436713272\r\n\r\n\u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: These approaches are no fixed guidlines but rather suggestions that can be supplemented, replaced or combined as desired.\r\n\r\nContact:\r\n\r\nAgnese Quadri, Art Inventory ETH Z\u00fcrich\r\nagnese.quadri@library.ethz.ch\r\n\r\nLouis Vaucher, Data-Orbit, Studio for Visual Communication St. Gallen\r\nlv@data-orbit.ch\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","maintainer":"AgneseQuadri","name":"Harald N\u00e4geli - H\u00f6hlenbewohner ","phase":"Challenge","progress":-1,"score":1,"source_url":"https://www.e-pics.ethz.ch/index/ETHBIB.Kunstinventar/Hackathon/Naegeli/","stats":{"commits":0,"during":0,"people":1,"sizepitch":3174,"sizetotal":3256,"total":9,"updates":7},"summary":"52 photographs of Harald N\u00e4geli\u2019s graffitis in the underground car park at the ETH","team":"AgneseQuadri","team_count":1,"updated_at":"2021-04-15T20:54","url":"https://hack.glam.opendata.ch/project/111","webpage_url":""},{"autotext":"","autotext_url":"","category_id":"","category_name":"","contact_url":"","created_at":"2021-04-12T15:36","download_url":"","event_name":"GLAMhack 2021","event_url":"https://hack.glam.opendata.ch/event/2","excerpt":"In Switzerland, Coffee shops have long been popular among consumers for work-related reasons, such as alternative workplaces to office spaces, as well as a source for on-the-go coffee when travelling to and from work.\r\n\r\nHow does demand & offer vary from canton to canton?

A diachronic 3D model would enable a wide range of applications. For example, one could walk with Zwingli through the streets to Froschauer's print shop. <p>\r\nWhile today\u2019s topographical data is freely available (at swisstopo and Stadt Z\u00fcrich), it is a challenge to go back in time, especially behind the earliest maps dating from the 18th century. \r\nIn his book \"Z\u00fcrich im Zeitraffer\" Thomas Germann gathered available archeological, printed and archival information and combined them all into his books with drawings of the city's development at different epochs. The illustrations show how much the topography has changed over time. Rivers have been diverted, swamps dried up and huge city walls were erected and torn down.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Idea:</b><br>\r\nBased on the information from Thomas Germann's illustrations in combination with current geodata models of the city, we want to develop a time-lapse representation in the form of a 3D visualization.\r\nPossible scenarios\r\n\r\nRepresenting the entire urban development of Zurich is too time-consuming. Therefore, we aim to develop a prototype or \"proof of concept\" within the GLAMhack. In order to simplify the complexity, the following approaches should be considered:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>step-by-step \"remodeling\" of the objects, starting from today's cityscape and based on current geodata\r\n<li>Division into two main topics:\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Modeling of topographic elements (Swisstopo + information from \"Z\u00fcrich im Zeitraffer\")\r\n\r\n<li>Modeling of structural aspects of buildings (open data + information from \"Z\u00fcrich im Zeitraffer\").\r\n\r\n</ol>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>Concentration on specific subareas:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Area-based modeling, e.g. today's Bahnhofstrasse, Lindenhof, etc.\r\n\r\n<li>Building-related modeling, e.g. Grossm\u00fcnster, ETH etc.\r\n</ol>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWith such a prototype we would like to show possible ways for further projects, which could possibly be pursued as Citizen Science projects.\r\n\r\nDatasets\r\n========\r\n\r\n<https://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/de/geodata/landscape/tlm3d.html#dokumente>\r\n\r\n<https://data.stadt-zuerich.ch/dataset?tags=polygondaten&tags=3d-stadtmodell>\r\n\r\nResources\r\n=========\r\n\r\n-   Germann, Thomas: [Z\u00fcrich im Zeitraffer](https://uzb.swisscovery.slsp.ch/permalink/41SLSP_UZB/rloemb/alma990018288450205508).

Currently only a skeleton of the code is written and some basic functionalities. I am very much open for collaboration!\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this App is to improve and enhance a person's interaction with Art. It aims at enabling two main capabilities:\r\n\r\n1. Allow the user to learn more about and track the art works that he/she encounters over time and allow to answer questions like:\r\n- Which art works have I seen in which galleries? \r\n- Where can I see more work of an artist?\r\n- How do the works that I've seen/liked relate to each other (e.g. based on art period, art school)?\r\n- Which artists/art movements have I seen most often?\r\nThey will also be able to give inputs about how they feel about the art works (e.g. inspiration, loneliness, connection). Furthermore the users will be able to share and connect with friends.\r\n\r\n2. Allow the users to enhance their art experience through Machine Learning, e.g. by using the following functionalities:\r\n- Generate a poem from an image (ref. https://github.com/researchmm/img2poem)\r\n- Classify an art work to an art movement \r\n\r\n## Technologies\r\n\r\nThe App is written in Python using the library Kivy. Based on the input for an artist name, it queries the API of WikiArt to retrieve artist details.
