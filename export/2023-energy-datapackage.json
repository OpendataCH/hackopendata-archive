We're glad you're here!\n\n## Getting Started\n\nThis README will guide you through the process of setting up your environment and working on the challenge. By the end of this guide, you'll be ready to dive into the provided datasets, create your predictive model, and help us improve grid stabilization.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nBefore you begin, please ensure you have the following prerequisites:\n\n1. **Access to the VM with Jupyter Hub:** We've provided a virtual machine with Jupyter Hub installed. This will serve as your development environment. Just go to our [Jupyter Hub](http://axe-lab-appl-energy-data-hackdays.westeurope.cloudapp.azure.com/hub) and sign in with a username (no special characters or spaces) and password of your choosing - just don't forget it.\n\nYou can also develop on your local machine if you prefer. Talk to us about getting the dataset onto your local machine.\n\n### Setting Up Your Environment\n\nFollow these steps to set up your environment and start working on the challenge:\n\n1. **Access Jupyter Hub:**\nOpen your web browser and navigate to the provided URL for Jupyter Hub. Log in using your credentials.\n\n2. **Clone the Git Repository:**\nOpen a terminal and clone this repo\n```console\ngit clone https://github.com/axpogroup/edh2023.git\ncd edh2023\n```\n\n3. **Accessing Datasets:**\nThe training and validation datasets for both substations are located in the `/data` directory on the Jupyter Hub VM. You can copy them to the data directory with \n```console\ncp /home/data/data.zip ~/edh2023/data.zip\nunzip data.zip\n```\n\n4. **Installing Dependencies:**\nCreate a virtual environment to install dependencies:\n```console\npython -m venv .venv\n```\nActivate the virtual environment\n```console\nsource .venv/bin/activate\n```\nTo ensure your environment has the necessary packages, run the following command:\n```console\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\nRegister the virtual environment as ipykernel:\n```console\npython -m ipykernel install --user --name=edh_venv\n```\nIt will take a few seconds for the new environment to show up as an available. You can open the `sample_notebook.ipynb` and select the environment as kernel once it is and get going with digging into the details.\n### Understanding the Challenge\n\nBefore you start coding, it's important to grasp the problem at hand:\n\n- You are provided with time series of substation measurements, energy production, weather data, and target voltages for two substations with shunt reactors.\n\n- The goal is to create a model that can predict voltages in the substation such that, based on these predictions, one can decide when to turn the shunt reactors on or off to keep the measured voltage close to the target voltage. You should keep the average **number of on-off/off-on switches below 2/day** to limit wear and tear on system components. One of the main challenges herein is\n\n### Your Task\n\nYour main task is to develop a predictive model that predicts the voltage in each substation and that can effectively recommend when to activate or deactivate shunt reactors in order to stabilize the grid voltages. Use the provided datasets to train and validate your model. They contain weather, electricity production, and grid measurement data. Take a look at the `sample_notebook.ipynb` to get started with analyzing the data.\n\nFeel free to explore different machine learning algorithms, techniques, and preprocessing methods. Don't hesitate to innovate and experiment!\n\n### Evaluation\n\nYou can evaluate your model with either the root mean square error for the voltage prediction or `utils.eval.alternative_strategy_reward`. Both of these are relevant metrics for us.\n\n## Need Help?\n\nIf you encounter any issues during the challenge or have questions about the provided datasets, feel free to ask one of us for help. \n\nHappy coding!\n","autotext_url":"https://github.com/axpogroup/edh2023","category_id":"","category_name":"","contact_url":"https://openenergydata.slack.com/archives/C05SASXF7K4","created_at":"2023-08-28T09:56","download_url":"https://github.com/axpogroup/edh2023/releases","event_name":"Energy Data Hackdays 2023","event_url":"https://hack.energy.opendata.ch/event/1","excerpt":"For grid stabilization, operators of different voltage levels have target voltage schedules.

For sake of simplicity, a virtual machine (VM) could be used to emulate the edge device with limited resources.\r\n\r\nTo make the deployment process simple, we ask you to use NuvlaEdge technology. The main\r\ngoal is to deploy the developed forecasting module using NuvlaEdge, a powerful edge\r\ncomputing platform. The objective is to optimize and efficiently use resources while achieving\r\naccurate predictions.\r\n\r\nThe evaluation of your solution will be based on the following criteria:\r\n\r\nModel Performance: The accuracy of your predictive model will be assessed using the Mean Squared Error (MSE) score. We are looking for models that can effectively capture the energy consumption/production patterns and generate accurate forecasts.\r\n\r\nOverhead: Your solution must be deployed on a limited resources device. It must also \u201ccohabit\u201d with NuvlaEdge. Avoiding overload and efficiently using the available resources will be crucial. It is therefore paramount that the footprint (CPU and memory) of your solution is as low as possible.\r\n\r\nOptimisation: We encourage you to take into account optimization concerns. This includes strategies to minimize resource contention, reduce computational complexity, and optimize memory usage, all while maintaining accurate predictions.\r\n\r\nSummary steps for the challenge:\r\n\r\n1. Develop the forecasting module as a Docker container: Create a predictive model for energy consumption/production based on the provided dataset, and encapsulate it along with its dependencies into a Docker container.\r\n2. Deploy the forecasting container: Use the NuvlaEdge platform to deploy the developed forecasting module.\r\n3. Monitor/Optimise resource usage\r\n4. Evaluate model performance: Assess the performance of your deployed model using evaluation metrics such as the Mean Squared Error (MSE) score.\r\n\r\nBy participating in this challenge, you will gain valuable experience in addressing the resource constraints and optimization challenges inherent in edge computing environments.
