Point to any hilltop within sight, tap on the red button and get the hill or mountain name, its distance and height above sea level.\r\n\r\nMONT is a Augmented Reality web app coded in \"vanilla\" JS. It is a proof of concept in order to demonstrate that AR applications for mobile phones can be done just by using open technologies such as HTML 5 (CSS 3, Javascript ES 6).\r\n\r\n<h3>Processing</h3>\r\nAfter geolocating the app processes a digital height model of Switzerland and interpolates the current height above sea level. It then triangulates the mountain peak or hilltop in question (horizontally and vertically) and searches the mountain database in order to determine the precise peak the user is pointing to.\r\n\r\n<h3>Tech</h3>\r\nMONT is coded in Javascript only (\"vanilla\" JS, hence no external dependencies, no frameworks, no libraries, no third-party services of any kind). MONT is a so-called flat-file webapp, which means that the required data (digital height model, toponymy and georeferences) are stored in JS arrays (instead of a database) that are cached by the web browser, so that the app, once loaded, will also work in offline mode.\r\n\r\n<h3>Data</h3>\r\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://opendata.swiss/de/dataset/das-digitale-hohenmodell-der-schweiz-mit-einer-maschenweite-von-200-m\" target=\"_blank\">Digital height model of Switzerland</a> (200m grid)</li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://opendata.swiss/de/dataset/swissnames3d-geografische-namen-der-landesvermessung\" target=\"_blank\">Swiss geographical Names</a> (georeferenced)</li></ul>\r\n\r\n<br><img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.dualstack.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/thumbs/240/twitter/322/thumbs-up_1f44d.png\" style=\"height: 120px; width: 120px;\"><br>\r\nCompared to programming native applications for specific platforms, using web technologies has two major advantages.\r\n<ol><li><strong>Cross-platform compatibility:</strong> Functionality and design will work across all platforms, no matter what operating system (or device).</li>\r\n<li><strong>No app installation:</strong> Developers do not need any app distribution service or app store. As soon as the web app is uploaded to a web server, it is accessible to any user. A link or a qr code is everything needed.<br><img src=\"https://bucketeer-036aa605-c047-4623-8610-f1764b90cf98.s3.amazonaws.com/glamhack/5/96IUZEEABUTNZMDTJG11DDJY/qr.png\" style=\"height:120px; width:120px;\"></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<br><img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.dualstack.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/thumbs/240/twitter/322/thumbs-down_1f44e.png\" style=\"height: 120px; width: 120px;\"><br>\r\nYet, there are a couple of downsides to the MONT project.\r\n<ol><li><strong>Compass heading (1):</strong> The HTML geolocation API according to the W3 web standard includes a <code>heading</code> property indicating the user's (i.e. the smartphone's) absolute orientation in degrees. Yet, despite of being part of the web standard this property has never been implemented. The <code>heading</code> property retrieved by the <code>getCurrentPosition()</code> method returns <code>null</code>.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Compass heading (2):</strong> iOS and Android handle web browser access to orientation data differently. While iOS delivers absolute compass data (by means of the non-standard <code>webkitcompassheading</code> property), Android only delivers rotation data that set 0 (i.e. North) to the direction the smartphone was heading towards when the page was loaded.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Sensor inaccuracy:</strong> Motion and compass sensors (magnetic compass module, motion sensors/gyroscope) built into modern smartphones are quite inaccurate. While there can be several mountain peaks within one single compass degree (especially given the MONT reach set to 20 kilometers), even a slight inaccuracy can lead to false results. This may change with future improvements to sensor technology.</li></ol>\r\n\r\n<h3>Team:</h3>\r\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.thomasweibel.ch\" target=\"_blank\">Prof. Thomas Weibel</a>, University of Applied Sciences of the Grisons (FHGR), Berne University of the Arts (HKB)</li>\r\n<li>Dirshti Gopwani, University of Applied Sciences and Arts of Southern Switzerland (SUPSI)</li></ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Credits</h3>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/de/home.html\" target=\"_blank\">Swiss Federal Office of Topography</a> (swisstopo)\r\n\r\n<h3>Social media</h3>\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/6_eYklTp37o?t=825\r\n\r\nhttps://twitter.com/OpendataCH/status/1588859823650934785","maintainer":"twb","name":"Mont","phase":"Sketching","progress":20,"score":98,"source_url":"","stats":{"commits":0,"during":45,"people":1,"sizepitch":5238,"sizetotal":5326,"total":66,"updates":64},"summary":"(05) Mont is an AR webapp that lets you discover the hills and mountain tops around you.","team":"twb","team_count":1,"updated_at":"2022-11-13T10:44","url":"https://hack.glam.opendata.ch/project/128","webpage_url":"https://www.canva.com/design/DAFREqkFeh0/view?utm_content=DAFREqkFeh0&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=publishsharelink"},{"autotext":"# Living Herbarium\r\n\r\nA Data Package that is part of a [#GLAMhack 2022](https://glam.opendata.ch) project to explore an extract from the Swiss National Databank of Vascular Plants.

None of us are domain experts, but we received detailed guidance and had some very helpful and inspiring meetings with our expert and data provider [Alessia Guggisberg](https://hack.glam.opendata.ch/user/AlessiaGuggisberg) who works at the ETH and maintains [Vascular plants](https://hack.glam.opendata.ch/project/136) datasets. We are also in contact with another team working on this data:\r\n\r\nhttps://hack.glam.opendata.ch/project/123\r\n\r\nThey downloaded and kindly helped us to get a first look of the data, which is too large to work with in a spreadsheet program. In parallel, we looked into the way [WikiSpecies](https://species.wikimedia.org) data is structured on Wikidata, and read up on the import mechanisms for making contributions. There has been prior work in bridging GBIF and Wikidata, which we wished to leverage.\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udca1 Read more in [Does Biodiversity Informatics \ud83d\udc98 Wikidata?](https://data-blog.gbif.org/post/wikidata/)\r\n\r\nUsing [OpenRefine](https://openrefine.org) and [Frictionless Data Creator](https://create.frictionlessdata.io) we have prepared a schema file comapatible with open data tools. This is a [Data Package](https://github.com/we-art-o-nauts/living-herbarium/blob/main/datapackage.json) based on a new extract from GBIF. It is filtered to three species with good coverage (around 15'000 observations) in Switzerland, as recommended to us by Alessia.\r\n\r\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/we-art-o-nauts/living-herbarium/main/datapackage.json\r\n\r\n<a name=\"demo\"></a>\r\n### Leaflet/Wikidata live demo\r\n\r\nBased on this we were able to create a simple web app, which displays a Leaflet map with locations pulled in from a Data Package, and photos of species from Wikidata APIs.

Recording metadata from the labels is, however, much more time-consuming, because writing is often difficult to decipher, relevant information is neither systematically ordered, nor complete, leading to putative errors and misinterpretations. To improve current digitisation workflows, improvements therefore need to focus on optimising metadata recording.\r\n\r\n## Benefit\r\n\r\nDeveloping the proposed pipeline would (i) save herbarium staff much time when recording label information and simultaneously prevent them from doing putative errors (e.g. attributing wrong collector or place names), (ii) allow to merge duplicates or re-assemble special collections virtually, and (iii) would facilitate transfer of metadata records between institutions, which share the same web portal or aggregator. Obviously, this pipeline could be useful to many natural history collections.\r\n\r\n## Case study\r\n\r\nThe vascular plant collection of the [United Herbaria Z+ZT of the University (Z) and ETH Zurich (ZT)](https://www.herbarien.uzh.ch/en/herbarien-zzt/gef%C3%A4sspflanzen.html) encompasses about 2.5 million objects, of which ca. 15% for a total of approximately 350,000 specimens have already been imaged and are publicly available on [GBIF](https://www.gbif.org) (see this short [movie](https://youtu.be/gFTE0pwUIwU) for a brief presentation of the institution). Metadata recording is, however, still very much incomplete.\r\n\r\n## Method\r\n\r\n1. Define search input, either by cropping portion of a label (e.g. header from a specific field trip, collector name or stamp), or by typing the given words in a dialog box\r\n2. Detect labels on voucher images and extract them\r\n3. Extract text from the labels using OCR and create searchable text indices\r\n4. Search for this pattern among all available images\r\n5. Retrieve batches of specimens that entail the given text as a list of barcodes\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\n\r\nHere are some images of vouchers, where what could typically be searched for (see red squares) is highlighted.\r\n\r\na) Search for \"Expedition in Angola\"\r\n![ Title ](https://bucketeer-036aa605-c047-4623-8610-f1764b90cf98.s3.amazonaws.com/glamhack/11472/NGMSMDH49K4CZT92FWXETXK7/ZT00071292.jpg)\r\n\r\nb) Search for \"Herbier de la Soie\"\r\n![ Title ](https://bucketeer-036aa605-c047-4623-8610-f1764b90cf98.s3.amazonaws.com/glamhack/11472/4V5Z43ZYF05DFM4XJLZJ8TYM/ZT00174195.jpg)\r\n\r\nc) Search for \"Herbier des Chanoines\"\r\n![ Title ](https://bucketeer-036aa605-c047-4623-8610-f1764b90cf98.s3.amazonaws.com/glamhack/11472/VKW5UY5OF8O4I6DG8NU1VHS8/ZT00176864.jpg)\r\n\r\nd) Search for \"Walo Koch\"\r\n![ Title ](https://bucketeer-036aa605-c047-4623-8610-f1764b90cf98.s3.amazonaws.com/glamhack/11472/NSOTYOWVH82NZQYJOGF6QV3S/ZT00184636.jpg)\r\n\r\ne) Search for \"Herbarium Chanoine M<sup>ce</sup> Besse\"\r\n![ Title ](https://bucketeer-036aa605-c047-4623-8610-f1764b90cf98.s3.amazonaws.com/glamhack/11472/HJQZZQ51ZO5HHMLCU2XK457L/ZT00205136.jpg)\r\n\r\n## Problem selected for the hackathon\r\n\r\nThe most useful thing for the curators who enter metadata for the scanned herbarium images would be to know which vouchers were created by the same botanist.\r\n\r\nVouchers can have multiple different labels on them. The oldest and most important one (for us) was added by the botanist who sampled the plant. This label is usually the biggest one, and at the bottom of the page. We saw that this label is often typed or stamped (but sometimes handwritten). Sometimes it includes the word 'leg.', which is short for legit, Latin for 'sampled by'.\r\n\r\nAfter that, more labels can be added whenever another botanist reviews the voucher. This might include identifying the species, and that could happen multiple times. These labels are usually higher up on the page, and often handwritten. They might include the word 'det.', short for 'determined by'.\r\n\r\nWe decided to focus on samples that were sampled by the botanist Walo Koch. He also determined a lot of samples, so it's important to distinguish between vouchers with 'leg. Walo Koch' and 'det. Walo Koch'.\r\n\r\n## Data Wrangling documentation\r\n\r\n[How did we clean and select the data ?](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OuS1bu_KBnTCv2vvLvxpzjTrcAQpD3mqXuBjb8g7DD8/edit#heading=h.x2pcrglrw5xs)\r\n\r\n## Selected tool\r\n\r\nWe decided to use [eScriptorium](https://escriptorium.fr/) to do OCR on the images of the vouchers. It's open source and we could host our own instance of it, which meant we could make as many requests as we wanted. We found out that there is a Python library to connect to an eScriptorium server, so hopefully we could automate processing images.\r\n\r\n[Setting up escriptorium on DigitalOcean](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13qZlFLs5615px16tSHfxO6HzZ2bB8DySKE3MjWtvwmE/edit#)\r\n\r\neScriptorium lets you manually transcribe a selection of images, and then builds a machine-learning model that it can use to automatically transcribe more of the same kind of image. You can also import a pre-existing model. We found a list of existing datasets for OCR and handwriting transcription at [HTR-United](https://htr-united.github.io/index.html#top), and Open Access models at [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/communities/ocr_models/search?page=1&size=20&access_right=open&file_type=mlmodel#).\r\n\r\nFrom the Zenodo list, we picked this model as probably a good fit with our data: [HTR-United - Manu McFrench V1 (Manuscripts of Modern and Contemporaneous French)](https://zenodo.org/record/6657809). We could refine the model further in eScriptorium by training it on our images, but this gave us a good start.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Video Demo\r\n\r\n[Video demo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JjFNZTQbnk8Tu8PwCOEJFLNNrql_27fQ/view)\r\n\r\n## Presentation\r\n\r\n[Final presentation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qLC9EVS6-frx7lSSu-3ALX8qIvSOmPUG/view?usp=sharing)\r\n\r\n## Google Drive folder\r\n\r\n[Data, documentation, ...](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Dk7BcrVtoRFW42oVLjZFyn0uqssov3l4)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Tools we tried but where we were not successful\r\n\r\n### Transkribus \r\nhttps://readcoop.eu/transkribus/.

definition](https://icom.museum/en/resources/standards-guidelines/museum-definition/) \u2013 \u201caccessible and inclusive, museums foster diversity and sustainability\u201d.\u00a0Still, just one step outside of the exhibition rooms, in museum shops and museum cafeterias, remnants of past worlds such as exclusionary dietary options or gemstones of questionable origin sold in museum shops are presented to the visitors, forming a sharp contrast to the intellectual menu offered by these institutions.\r\n\r\nThe challenge \u201cnoon at the museum\u201d aims at addressing museum sustainability and institutional responsibility. It focuses on museum restaurants and their surroundings to answer the simple question for vegetarians and vegans \u201cCan I eat here?\u201d. It relies on open and crowd-sourced data to document the current existing situation in Canton Ticino, to improve the situation and to design a tool and a process for the future.\r\n\r\n![Noon-at-the-museum.gif](https://bucketeer-036aa605-c047-4623-8610-f1764b90cf98.s3.amazonaws.com/glamhack/11531/LDL6F6UBK0778YEC1CUU507M/noonatthemuseum.gif)\r\n\r\n\u00a9 OpenStreetMap contributors, visualization based on [\"Is OSM up-to-date?\" by Francesco Frassinelli](https://is-osm-uptodate.frafra.eu/#13/46.17615/8.75825), adjusted for the GLAMhack2022\r\n\r\n# Hackathon challenge, prototype and how-to\r\n\r\nAs a prototype of the concept, our scope falls on museums in Ticino. We provided answers to the following questions:\r\n\r\n* How many museums have a restaurant?\r\n* Do they offer at least one vegan/vegetarian option?\r\n* Can we find vegan/vegetarian options nearby (within a 50m radius around the museum)?\r\n* Can we identify a system which will allow us to have access to this information in the future?\r\n\r\nWithin this challenge we documented our research and development process and we captured workflows and discussions as they unfolded.\r\n\r\n# Process documentation\r\n\r\n## Summary of the prototype (Ticino Canton)\r\n\r\n1. Identification. We identified the information about restaurants and museums which can be included in OpenStreetMap. OpenStreetMap doesn\u2019t allow to enter information on the menu-level, however, it allows to embed an URL to the menu and provides multiple fields that give a summary over the whole. There is a \u201cdiet type\u201d field available in OpenStreetMap that allows for various tags like \u201cvegan\u201d/\u201dvegetarian\u201d/\u201dgluten-free\u201d/\u2026 These tags can further have four different values: Yes, No, Only, (limited). There is no field or tag indicating whether explicit information on the ingredients is included in the menu.\r\n2. Data extraction from OpenStreetMap. Using OpenStreetMap it is possible to query the map data for restaurants and cafeterias with vegetarian and vegan lunch options located within 50m from museums. At first there were no results for 50 m around museums in Canton Ticino; at the end of the GLAHack the results were 6 restaurants with vegetarian options (4 also vegan) over a total of 21 restaurants (please refer below; [search-query](https://overpass-turbo.eu/s/1nr0)); within 200 m radius we found 14 vegetarian restaurants (9 also vegan) at the end of our work over a total of 134 restaurants ([search-query](https://overpass-turbo.eu/s/1nr1)).\r\n3. Data related to museum restaurants and cafeteria. We searched museums.ch (which has the option to [search for museum](https://www.museums.ch/en/museums/museum-finder/) with a restaurant or a cafeteria in a specific canton) which currently lists 6 museums meeting the criteria; we collected information from people living in the area who know the museums. We found 12 museums with a restaurant or cafeteria, as well as 2 museums which explicitly refer to picnic sites in their website.\r\n4. Checking diet options: We checked the menus available online and we called 5 restaurants to check for vegetarian or vegan options. The best results with the calls were collected from a person with experience in calling restaurant to organise events. 6 restaurants have vegetarian and vegan options explicitly mentioned in their menu or in their restaurant description. By calling, restaurants provided availability in providing vegetarian and vegan options, but they were not included in OpenStreetMap; 1 restaurant reported availability in providing vegetarian options only.\r\n5. Data related to museums on Wikidata. On Wikidata there are 118 museums of Canton Ticino uploaded in 2018. We checked the [data](https://w.wiki/5uru) and we improved it (fixing broken links, completing names in English, fixing redundancy in administration units); we added information about restaurants, shops and picnic sites in the property [P912](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P912) and we suggested to the Wikidata communities to include this property in the project Museum (please refer to the [discussion page](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata_talk:WikiProject_Museums#Museum_services_(shop,_restaurant...)_-_P912))\r\n6. Data related to museums on OpenStreetMap. On OpenStreetMap we updated information related to the restaurants and cafeteria; we used and tested the how-to document produced (see below). All changes done during the team during the hackathon were tagged with the hashtag #GLAMhack2022 and can be found on [OSMCha](https://osmcha.org/changesets/128502134/?filters=%7B%22metadata%22%3A%5B%7B%22label%22%3A%22hashtags%3D%23GLAMhack2022%22%2C%22value%22%3A%22hashtags%3D%23GLAMhack2022%22%7D%5D%7D).\r\n\r\n## Reproducibility and How-to\r\n\r\nWe wrote, illustrated and tested a [how-to document](https://bucketeer-036aa605-c047-4623-8610-f1764b90cf98.s3.amazonaws.com/glamhack/11531/SGG55B528BPA9Q3KG0QAEA4G/How_to_edit_restaurants_on_OpenStreetMap.pdf) for potential future contributors. The document guides them step-by-step through the workflow of tagging the available diet options of restaurants in the vicinity of a museum.\r\n\r\n# Results\r\n\r\nThe work implemented allowed to create a simple tool and process, which relies on open and crowd-sourced data and which provides access to information related to vegetarian and vegan options in restaurants in and around museums. This process can be extended to other features of restaurants and to features of museum shops.\r\n\r\nThe focus on Canton Ticino allowed to improve open data related to cultural institutions and to enrich them with reference to restaurants and shops.\r\n\r\n# Discussion\r\n\r\nThe work highlighted how restaurants and shops are indeed not considered an integrated part of museum strategies and design. They are often not presented in their websites and there is a very limited attention to a sustainable, accessible and inclusive approach.\r\n\r\nFurthermore working on the challenge arose the following questions:\r\n\r\n* **Data quality**\r\n    * How to define \u201dvegan enough\u201d?

Unable to use his hands to type on a keyboard, Lockard made a special request during his long recovery in hospital: He asked for a PLATO terminal. PLATO (Programmed Logic for Automatic Teaching Operations) was the first generalized computer-assisted instruction system designed and built by the University of Illinois.\r\n\r\nThe computer game Lockard started coding on his PLATO terminal was a puzzle game displaying Chinese \u00abMah-Jongg\u00bb tiles, pieces used for the Chinese game that had become increasingly popular in the United States. Lockard accordingly called his game \u00abMah-Jongg solitaire\u00bb. In 1986 Activision released the game under the name of \u00abShanghai\u00bb (see screenshot), and when Microsoft decided to add the game to their Windows Entertainment Pack f\u00fcr Win 3.x in 1990 (named \u00abTaipei\u00bb for legal reasons) Mah-Jongg Solitaire became one of the world's most popular computer games ever.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://bucketeer-036aa605-c047-4623-8610-f1764b90cf98.s3.amazonaws.com/glamhack/5/B8LISLOVTHSVV18R3IG6JE4D/letterjongg.jpg\" style=\"float: left; height: 420px; width: 640px; margin: 0 10px 10px 0\">\r\n\u00abCardjongg\u00bb aims at translating the ancient far-east Mah-Jongg imagery into western playing cards iconography. The Chinese Mahjongg tiles - with few exceptions - consist of four suits representing numbers from 1 to 9, almost exactly as western playing cards do. The \u00abCardjongg\u00bb project will therefore display playing cards instead of the traditional Chinese Mah-jongg tiles. \u00abCardjongg\u00bb will be based upon \u00abLetterjongg\u00bb the Glamhack project I did in 2018 at the Swiss National Museum in Zurich displaying Renaissance letters instead of the ancient far-east imagery.\r\n\r\nNeeds: Data providers (historical playing cards, other suitable imagery)","maintainer":"twb","name":"08 Cardjongg","phase":"Challenge","progress":-100,"score":1,"source_url":"","stats":{"commits":0,"during":1,"people":1,"sizepitch":2121,"sizetotal":2260,"total":16,"updates":14},"summary":"Mahjongg Solitaire is a popular puzzle game.

We would be happy to provide our data set at the next GLAMhack. Thank you for your understanding.</div>\r\n\r\nThe Aargau Cantonal Library defines as an authority which creators are considered \"Aargauer\" or have a strong enough connection to Aargau for their works to be systematically collected (including writers, composers and film directors). To accomplish this task, the library maintains, on the one hand, an internal list of names of these persons, which it is currently enriching with GND IDs. On the other hand, it maintains the Aargau Bibliography in its primo discovery.\r\n\r\nWe intend to upload this name list to Wikidata so that it can be used in the context of GLAMhack 2022. Our goal is to make the regional cultural output and also our work as a patrimonial institution more visible. As an output, we can imagine three things:\r\n\r\n1) historical, geographical, thematic visualizations of the data on creators and their works (link between Wikidata and linked open bibliographic data like in library catalogues). For example using [Primo Discovery](https://https://abn-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/primo-explore/search?query=any,contains,Klaus,%20Merz&tab=default_tab&search_scope=ABN51&vid=41ABN_VU1&lang=de_DE&offset=0).\r\n\r\n2) create a novel search entry point beside our classic primo discovery to facilitate the exploration of regional cultural creation, analogous to the Collection Explorer the Bodleian Libraries had offered until recently (http://glam-discovery.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/) using the [Z39.50](https://www.ag.ch/de/verwaltung/bks/kultur/kulturpflege/bibliothek-archiv/kantonsbibliothek/aargauer-bibliotheksnetz) interface\r\n\r\n3) the development of a portal on Aargauer cultural creation, analogous to www.literapedia-bern.ch, but purely Wikidata- and Wikipedia-driven (we would use this, among other things, to drive the writing and addition of Wikipedia articles).\r\n\r\n## Sample\r\n\r\n### Subject\r\n\r\nhttps://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q123127\r\n\r\n### Predicate\r\n\r\nhttps://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P361\r\n\r\n### Object\r\n\r\nhttps://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q114068732\r\n\r\n### Data\r\n\r\n| Name  | Instance of | Occupation | or evtl.

In the discussion, we heard the idea of a \"Denkmal Friedhof\" (monument cemetery) mentioned by [Jan Morgenthaler](https://www.zurich-transit-maritim.ch/de/ahoi/kurzbiografie-jan-morgenthaler/), who first proposed this in 1991 for the [Blatterwiese Park](https://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/ted/de/index/gsz/natur-erleben/park-und-gruenanlagen/parkanlagen-von-az/blatterwiese.html) in Zurich. The idea is echoed in this recent submission to the \u00abMal Denken!\u00bb project from SAGW:\r\n\r\n> _\"Monuments are monuments of a time. They often say more about the time in which they were created than about the personalities they represent. Sooner or later, a monument falls out of time and becomes street furniture, which can be an urban planning quality, but does not have much to do with the original monument quality. In this respect, it is no more than logical to bury monuments that have died of significance or to move them to the monument cemetery.\"_ --[Eingabe 62_HB, denk-mal-denken.ch](https://denk-mal-denken.ch/wettbewerb-publikumspreis/denkmal/ausser-konkurrenz-der-denkmal-friedhof)\r\n\r\nA digital cemetery would be accessible online through a fitting platform (perhaps in Mozilla Hubs or another open Metaverse). There would be a set of rules for adding monuments to it. We could inspire ourselves from works of platforms past, such as this virtual cemetery for pets in the (now defunct) Second Life platform:\r\n\r\n![](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2F1.bp.blogspot.com%2F-wCHHuUF9R8s%2FVxcq-8IJHgI%2FAAAAAAAAyrk%2FJIZF7mtCNykV-VQovY0SD7t4SzPwAadCwCLcB%2Fw1200-h630-p-k-no-nu%2Fdeaflegacypetcemetary04.jpg&f=1&nofb=1&ipt=12475004e8b3e333fbc440057ab2a3a1b9edacc71e36e4acc6267ef75fb41c6d&ipo=images)\r\n_Image source: [Bixyl Shuftan](https://slnewser.blogspot.com/2016/04/peace-valley-pet-cemetery.html)_\r\n\r\n## Game Rules\r\n\r\nMuch of this challenge is having to do with designing a set of rules around governing how monuments are managed in a community space. As a start, we can adapt the Game Rules presented in the idea above:\r\n\r\n1. A \"dead\" monument makes room for a new monument, which in turn meets a need of the present (to stimulate thought or remembrance), or the space that has become free simply remains empty. Monuments should thus regain their memorial potential and not simply represent eternal positions in architectural culture. **Connect this to modern thought about sustaining the built environment.**\r\n2. The cemetery does not cancel the old monument, but assigns it a new place. The place of the monument that has fallen out of the present. The monument is neither relativised, nor badmouthed, nor reinterpreted or defaced. It continues to exist, but as a \"dead\" monument and cultural heritage. As a monument that no longer has a social contract, but has \"been\". As a collective, the \"dead\" monuments formulate a new added value over time. They are witnesses of past presences and as such, like the graves of famous contemporaries in the cemeteries of past centuries, are themselves a monument - one of the present. **Embed cultural values and far-reaching visions in your design.**\r\n3. The game rules designate which monuments for the cemetery and where this change will be carried out. Whether it takes 10,000 signatures and a vote, or whether every 10 years building culture experts subject the monuments to a lifetime check and evaluate cemetery candidates - different paths are conceivable. **We could create rule sets connected to open data sources.**\r\n4. It would make sense to link the processes for the removal of a (physical) monument that has fallen out of time and for the erection of a new monument. The discussion about possible relocation alone would produce more sense than the mere preservation of a monument's value. **Bring together our community on a participative platform like Decidim.**\r\n\r\n## Data sources\r\n\r\n![](https://opendata.swiss/images/logo_horizontal.png)\r\n\r\nhttps://opendata.swiss/en/dataset/bundesinventar-der-landschaften-und-naturdenkmaler-bln\r\n\r\nhttps://opendata.swiss/de/dataset/kulturguterschutzinventar-mit-objekten-von-nationaler-bedeutung\r\n\r\n- [Schweizerische Stein-Denkm\u00e4ler Inventar](http://www.ssdi.ch/)\r\n- [Wikipedia](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kategorie:Denkmal_in_der_Schweiz)\r\n\r\n## Related projects\r\n\r\n[![Screenshot of denk-mal-denken game](https://bucketeer-036aa605-c047-4623-8610-f1764b90cf98.s3.amazonaws.com/glamhack/1/766HLHC01G903R44JGTIPTTA/Screenshot_from_20221019_143258.jpg)](https://denk-mal-denken.ch/spiel)\r\n\r\n- [(Denk)mal Spielen](https://denk-mal-denken.ch/spiel) game (pictured above)\r\n- [Wiki Loves Monuments](https://www.wikimedia.de/wlm-preisverleihung/)\r\n- [App zum Tag des offenen Denkmals](https://www.tag-des-offenen-denkmals.de/app/)\r\n- [Valais Wallis Time Machine](https://www.timemachine.eu/time-machine-ebu-hackathon/)","maintainer":"loleg","name":"Monument Cemetery ","phase":"Challenge","progress":-100,"score":0,"source_url":"","stats":{"commits":0,"during":0,"people":1,"sizepitch":5376,"sizetotal":5448,"total":6,"updates":4},"summary":"(09) A space where monuments and memorials go to rest (Denkmal Friedhof)","team":"loleg","team_count":1,"updated_at":"2022-11-10T15:42","url":"https://hack.glam.opendata.ch/project/129","webpage_url":""},{"autotext":"<p></p>","autotext_url":"","category_id":"","category_name":"","contact_url":"","created_at":"2022-10-04T15:08","download_url":"","event_name":"GLAMhack 2022","event_url":"https://hack.glam.opendata.ch/event/3","excerpt":"# Projects\r\n\r\nhttps://hack.glam.opendata.ch/project/177\r\n\r\n_This was presented as Challenge 6 at GLAMhack 2022._\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"huge\">Challenge</h1>\r\n\r\nDevelop a plugin to compare the distribution of (mainly historical) observations from natural history collections with approximate (mainly contemporary) data from Swiss biodiversity portals.\r\n\r\n## Problem\r\n\r\nSwiss biodiversity portals like InfoSpecies publish most of their georeferenced data as 5km square grids in GBIF (see for example [here](http...","hashtag":"","id":124,"ident":null,"image_url":"https://bucketeer-036aa605-c047-4623-8610-f1764b90cf98.s3.amazonaws.com/glamhack/11472/O8WX1PYZHSU19EDL5J6G38BQ/Adonis_aestivalis_Z000209898.jpg","is_challenge":true,"is_webembed":true,"logo_color":"","logo_icon":"","longtext":"# Projects\r\n\r\nhttps://hack.glam.opendata.ch/project/177\r\n\r\n_This was presented as Challenge 6 at GLAMhack 2022._\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"huge\">Challenge</h1>\r\n\r\nDevelop a plugin to compare the distribution of (mainly historical) observations from natural history collections with approximate (mainly contemporary) data from Swiss biodiversity portals.\r\n\r\n## Problem\r\n\r\nSwiss biodiversity portals like InfoSpecies publish most of their georeferenced data as 5km square grids in GBIF (see for example [here](https://atlas.infoflora.ch/en/?taxon_id=1021200)).

Between 2019 and 2021, all (ca. 90,000) vouchers from the canton of Valais have been imaged and publicly released in [GBIF](https://www.gbif.org). More than half (ca. 55\u2019000) of the specimens were [transcribed and georeferenced](https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/map?country=CH&dataset_key=064508e2-255e-4d82-9f13-05d73476cc03&gadm_gid=CHE.23_1) for a total of nearly 1,200 taxa occurring in Valais. These historical data could now be compared with ongoing vegetation surveys from the FloraVS project, which are being published on [GBIF](https://www.gbif.org) via InfoFlora.\r\n\r\n## Basic approach\r\n\r\n1. Specify taxon in search field\r\n2. Extract historical data of the given taxon from the United Herbaria Z+ZT\r\n3. Extract contemporary data of the given taxon from InfoFlora\r\n4. Normalise all data to 5km square grids\r\n5. Create distribution map for the time period before and after 1980\r\n\r\n## Jump start\r\n\r\nI suggest to use the open-source JavaScript library called [Leaflet](open-source%20JavaScript%20library) to solve this challenge.

Accordingly, one should implement a time slider, to facilitate temporal comparisons and accommodate data from other databases (*e.g.* [iNaturalist](https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/map?publishing_org=28eb1a3f-1c15-4a95-931a-4af90ecb574d&taxon_key=5371707&gadm_gid=CHE.23_1)).\r\n* To better assess the reasons for putative distributional changes through time (*e.g.* habitat loss, urbanisation), one should integrate the historical Dufour and Siegfried swisstopo maps. Further  maps (*e.g.* land use, vegetation type, road network) are, of course, welcome! Having the opportunity to visualise two maps (from two different time periods) side-by-side might also be useful, but maybe it would be more elegant to establish a hypothetical distribution based upon all the observations and let the internet users choose which data they want to plot against it (*e.g.* only data from a given dataset or a given time period).\r\n* In order to identify putative wrong determinations, one should be able to access any images (if available) pertaining to the mapped datapoints (see examples from the [United Herbaria Zurich Z+ZT](https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/3383335649) or [iNaturalist](https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/3302250815)). Generally, implementing dynamic popups with important information pertaining to the datapoints would be a nice feature!\r\n* Logically, the code should be setup in such a way that data are being automatically retrieved from GBIF, so that one always constructs the most current map.\r\n* I herewith compared data of only one species (*Adonis aestivalis* L.), but ideally internet users should be able to customise their map based on following criteria: plant species, administrative areas (cantons), data sources (national database, herbaria, citizen science platforms), etc.\r\n* Herbaria should be able to integrate the code into their websites.\r\n* Export functions (with copyrights) are needed.","maintainer":"AlessiaGuggisberg","name":"historicalMAP","phase":"Challenge","progress":0,"score":0,"source_url":"","stats":{"commits":0,"during":1,"people":1,"sizepitch":12918,"sizetotal":13017,"total":85,"updates":83},"summary":"Build interactive maps in HTML format to assess changes in species distribution through time","team":"AlessiaGuggisberg","team_count":1,"updated_at":"2022-11-13T11:06","url":"https://hack.glam.opendata.ch/project/124","webpage_url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gFTE0pwUIwU"},{"autotext":"","autotext_url":"https://opendata.swiss/de/dataset/inventory-of-research-libraries-in-switzerland","category_id":"","category_name":"","contact_url":"mailto:thomas.weibel@bluewin.ch","created_at":"2022-10-04T07:13","download_url":"","event_name":"GLAMhack 2022","event_url":"https://hack.glam.opendata.ch/event/3","excerpt":"HTML5 web technology has greatly evolved in the last decade: Simple webpages can determine the user's precise location, his heading, and they can access the smartphone's gyroscope angles as well as its camera stream.
