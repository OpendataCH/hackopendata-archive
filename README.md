# hackopendata-archive

The collected results of [Opendata.ch Hackdays](https://opendata.ch/projects/hackathons/) and community sprints. 

We are grateful for all the contributions made by our community over the years, and would like to use this dataset to acknowledge the impact of your work.

## Technical

This is a [Data Package](https://frictionlessdata.io/) created from data exported using the [Dribdat API](https://dribdat.cc/contribute.html#api-guide).

Inside the root folder you can find scripts used to generate the data files, and a `datapackage.json` used for quality control.

In the `export` folder are individual Data Packages of the events.

Please check the Issues, leave us any questions there or in [our forum](https://forum.opendata.ch).
